        "sang save to chant dismal dirges.\"\n",
        "\"Perhaps it's the land they live in,\" answered the king. \"A gloomier land never was--all of hills, darkly\n",

        "Thoth-amon's eyes narrowed. For all his iron self-control, he was near bursting with long pent-up shame,\n",
        "hate and rage, ready to take any sort of a desperate chance. What he did not reckon on was the fact that\n",
        "Dion saw him, not as a human being with a brain and a wit, but simply a slave, and as such, a creature\n",

        "\"Listen to me,\" said Thoth. \"You will be king. But you little know the mind of Ascalante. You can not trust\n",

        "places to exalt me above them. They hated me, but they feared me, for I controlled beings from outside\n",
        "which came at my call and did my bidding. By Set, mine enemy knew not the hour when he might awake\n",
        "at midnight to feel the taloned fingers of a nameless horror at his throat! I did dark and terrible magic\n",
        "with the Serpent Ring of Set, which I found in a nighted tomb a league beneath the earth, forgotten before\n",
        "the first man crawled out of the slimy sea.\n",
        "\"But a thief stole the Ring and my power was broken. The magicians rose up to slay me, and I fled.\n",

        "fell upon us. All in the caravan were slain except myself; I saved my life by revealing my identity to\n",

        "\"To hold me fast, he wrote of me in a manuscript, and sealed it and gave it into the hands of a hermit who\n",

        "to his enemies, for then the hermit would open the manuscript and read--thus Ascalante instructed him.\n",

        "the width of half a world between us would suffice to save me from such a doom as would blast the soul\n",
        "of a bronze statue. Only a king with castles and hosts of swordsmen could protect me. So I have told you\n",
        "my secret, and urge that you make a pact with me. I can aid you with my wisdom, and you can protect\n",
        "me. And some day I will find the Ring--\"\n",
        "\"Ring? Ring?\" Thoth had underestimated the man's utter egoism. Dion had not even been listening to the\n",

        "his self-centeredness.\n",

        "who swore he stole it from a wizard far to the south, and that it would bring me luck. I paid him enough,\n",
        "Mitra knows. By the gods, I need all the luck I can have, what with Volmana and Ascalante dragging me\n",

        "superstitious nature had prompted him to collect.\n",
        "\"Ah, here it is!\" He triumphantly lifted a ring of curious make. It was of a metal like copper, and was\n",
        "made in the form of a scaled serpent, coiled in three loops, with its tail in its mouth. Its eyes were yellow\n",
        "gems which glittered balefully. Thoth-amon cried out as if he had been struck, and Dion wheeled and\n",
        "gaped, his face suddenly bloodless. The slave's eyes were blazing, his mouth wide, his huge dusky hands\n",
        "outstretched like talons.\n",

        "forgetful of it, Thoth grasped the ring in both hands, his dark eyes blazing with a fearful avidness.\n",
        "\"My Ring!\" he whispered in terrible exultation. \"My power!\"\n",
        "How long he crouched over the baleful thing, motionless as a statue, drinking the evil aura of it into his\n",

        "from the nighted abysses where it had been questing, the moon was rising, casting long shadows across\n",

        "been the lord of Attalus.\n",
        "\"No more, Ascalante, no more!\" whispered the Stygian, and his eyes burned red as a vampire's in the\n",
        "gloom. Stooping, he cupped a handful of congealing blood from the sluggish pool in which his victim\n",
        "sprawled, and rubbed it in the copper serpent's eyes until the yellow sparks were covered by a crimson\n",

        "which a tenuous shadow hovered. As he continued his whispered incantations, this shadow grew in size\n",
        "and clarity, until it stood out distinct and horrific. Its outline was not unlike that of a gigantic baboon, but\n",

        "highly polished and gleamed dull, and they were carved with the figures of ancient heroes and halfforgotten gods. He shuddered to see the vast shadowy outlines of the Nameless Old Ones, and he knew\n",

        "He came upon a wide stair carved in the solid rock, and the sides of the shaft were adorned with esoteric\n",

        "smashed his broken hilt like a cestus into the swordsman's temple. The man's brains spattered in his face.\n",
        "\"Watch the door, five of you!\" screamed Ascalante, dancing about the edge of the singing steel whirlpool,\n",
        "for he feared that Conan might smash through their midst and escape. The rogues drew back\n",
        "momentarily, as their leader seized several and thrust them toward the single door, and in that brief\n",

        "frozen in a death snarl of fury--his eyes blazing terribly through the mist of blood which veiled them. The\n",
        "men faltered--wild, criminal and dissolute though they were, yet they came of a breed men called\n",
        "civilized, with a civilized background; here was the barbarian--the natural killer. They shrank back--the\n",
        "dying tiger could still deal death.\n",

        "Another misguided desperado chose this instant to charge, followed halfÂheartedly by his fellows. He\n",
        "intended killing Conan before the Cimmerian could wrench his ax from the floor, but his judgment was\n",
        "faulty. The red ax lurched up and crashed down and a crimson caricature of a man catapulted back\n",
        "against the legs of the attackers.\n",
        "At that instant a fearful scream burst from the rogues at the door as a black misshapen shadow fell across\n",
        "the wall. All but Ascalante wheeled at that cry, and then, howling like dogs, they burst blindly through\n",
        "the door in a raving, blaspheming mob, and scattered through the corridors in screaming flight.\n",
        "Ascalante did not look toward the door; he had eyes only for the wounded king. He supposed that the\n",
        "noise of the fray had at last roused the palace, and that the loyal guards were upon him, though even in\n",
        "that moment it seemed strange that his hardened rogues should scream so terribly in their flight. Conan\n",
        "did not look toward the door because he was watching the outlaw with the burning eyes of a dying wolf.\n",

        "\"All seems to be lost, particularly honor,\" he murmured. \"However, the king is dying on his feet--and--\"\n",
        "Whatever other cogitation might have passed through his mind is not to be known; for, leaving the\n",
        "sentence uncompleted, he ran lightly at Conan just as the Cimmerian was perforce employing his ax arm\n",
        "to wipe the blood from his blinded eyes.\n",
        "But even as he began his charge, there was a strange rushing in the air and a heavy weight struck\n",
        "terrifically between his shoulders. He was dashed headlong and great talons sank agonizingly in his flesh.\n",
        "Writhing desperately beneath his attacker, he twisted his head about and stared into the face of\n",
        "nightmare and lunacy. Upon him crouched a great black thing which he knew was born in no sane or\n",

        "The hideousness of its face transcended mere bestiality. It might have been the face of an ancient, evil\n",
        "mummy, quickened with demoniac life. In those abhorrent features the outlaw's dilated eyes seemed to\n",
        "see, like a shadow in the madness that enveloped him, a faint and terrible resemblance to the slave Thothamon. Then Ascalante's cynical and all-sufficient philosophy deserted him, and with a ghastly cry he\n",
        "gave up the ghost before those slavering fangs touched him.\n",
        "Conan, shaking the blood drops from his eyes, stared frozen. At first he thought it was a great black\n",

        "flying weapon glanced singing from the slanting skull it should have crushed, and the king was hurled\n",
        "half-way across the chamber by the impact of the giant body.\n",
        "The slavering jaws closed on the arm Conan flung up to guard his throat, but the monster made no effort\n",
        "to secure a death-grip. Over his mangled arm it glared fiendishly into the king's eyes, in which there\n",
        "began to be mirrored a likeness of the horror which stared from the dead eyes of Ascalante. Conan felt his\n",
        "soul shrivel and begin to be drawn out of his body, to drown in the yellow wells of cosmic horror which\n",

        "his bloody lips to shriek his hate and loathing, but only a dry rattle burst from his throat.\n",
        "But the horror that paralyzed and destroyed Ascalante roused in the Cimmerian a frenzied fury akin to\n",
        "madness. With a volcanic wrench of his whole body he plunged backward, heedless of the agony of his\n",
        "torn arm, dragging the monster bodily with him. And his outflung hand struck something his dazed\n",
        "fighting brain recognized as the hilt of his broken sword. Instinctively he gripped it and struck with all\n",
        "the power of nerve and thew, as a man stabs with a dagger. The broken blade sank deep and Conan's arm\n",
        "was released as the abhorrent mouth gaped as in agony. The king was hurled violently aside, and lifting\n",
        "himself on one hand he saw, as one mazed, the terrible convulsions of the monster from which thick\n",
        "blood was gushing through the great wound his broken blade had torn. And as he watched, its struggles\n",
        "ceased and it lay jerking spasmodically, staring upward with its grisly dead eyes. Conan blinked and\n",
        "shook the blood from his own eyes; it seemed to him that the thing was melting and disintegrating into a\n",
        "slimy unstable mass.\n",
        "Then a medley of voices reached his ears, and the room was thronged with the finally roused people of\n",
        "the court--knights, peers, ladies, men-at-arms, councillors--all babbling and shouting and getting in one\n",
        "another's way. The Black Dragons were on hand, wild with rage, swearing and ruffling, with their hands\n",
        "on their hilts and foreign oaths in their teeth. Of the young officer of the door guard nothing was seen,\n",
        "nor was he found then or later, though earnestly sought after.\n",
        "\"Gromel! Volmana! Rinaldo!\" exclaimed Publius, the high councillor, wringing his fat hands among the\n",

        "\"The guard is here, you old fool!\" cavalierly snapped Pallantides, commander of the Black Dragons,\n",
        "forgetting Publius' rank in the stress of the moment. \"Best stop your caterwauling and aid us to bind the\n",

        "\"Yes, yes!\" cried Publius, who was a man of plans rather than action. \"We must bind his wounds. Send for\n",
        "every leech of the court! Oh, my lord, what a black shame on the city! Are you entirely slain?\"\n",

        "outlaw.\n",
        "\"Had you seen what he and I saw,\" growled the king, sitting up despite the protests of the leeches, \"you\n",

        "pointing fruitlessly. Where the monster had died, only the bare floor met his eyes.\n",
        "\"Crom!\" he swore. \"The thing's melted back into the foulness which bore it!\" \"The king is delirious,\"\n",
        "whispered a noble. Conan heard and swore with barbaric oaths.\n",
        "\"By Badb, Morrigan, Macha and Nemain!\" he concluded wrathfully. \"I am sane! It was like a cross\n",
        "between a Stygian mummy and a baboon. It came through the door, and Ascalante's rogues fled before it.\n",
        "It slew Ascalante, who was about to run me through. Then it came upon me and I slew it--how I know\n",
        "not, for my ax glanced from it as from a rack. But I think that the Sage Epemitreus had a hand in it--\"\n",
        "\"Hark how he names Epemitreus, dead for fifteen hundred years!\" they whispered to each other.\n",
        "\"By Ymir!\" thundered the king. \"This night I talked with Epemitreus! He called to me in my dreams, and I\n",

        "\"In Mitra's name, lord king, be silent!\" It was the high priest of Mitra who cried out, and his countenance\n",
        "was ashen.\n",
        "Conan threw up his head like a lion tossing back its mane, and his voice was thick with the growl of the\n",
        "angry lion.\n",
        "\"Am I a slave, to shut my mouth at your command?\"\n",
        "\"Nay, nay, my lord!\" The high priest was trembling, but not through fear of the royal wrath. \"I meant no\n",
        "offense.\" He bent his head close to the king and spoke in a whisper that carried only to Conan's ears.\n",
        "\"My lord, this is a matter beyond human understanding. Only the inner circle of the priestcraft know of\n",
        "the black stone corridor carved in the black heart of Mount Golamira, by unknown hands, or of the\n",
        "phoenix-guarded tomb where Epemitreus was laid to rest fifteen hundred years ago. And since that time\n",
        "no living man has entered it, for his chosen priests, after placing the Sage in the crypt, blocked up the\n",
        "outer entrance of the corridor so that no man could find it, and today not even the high priests know\n",
        "where it is. Only by word of mouth, handed down by the high priests to the chosen few, and jealously\n",
        "guarded, does the inner circle of Mitra's acolytes know of the resting place of Epemitreus in the black\n",

        "and were fastened to a band of steel about his waist, a band broad as his hand and half an inch thick. The\n",

        "coldly, white as hoar-frost. Surely this reptile was one born and grown in darkness, yet its eyes were full\n",
        "of evil and sure sight. It looped its titan coils in front of the captive, and the great head on the arching\n",
        "neck swayed a matter of inches from his face. Its forked tongue almost brushed his lips as it darted in and\n",
        "out, and its fetid odor made his senses reel with nausea. The great yellow eyes burned into his, and\n",
        "Conan gave back the glare of a trapped wolf. He fought against the mad impulse to grasp the great\n",
        "arching neck in his tearing hands. Strong beyond the comprehension of civilized man, he had broken the\n",
        "neck of a python in a fiendish battle on the Stygian coast, in his corsair days. But this reptile was\n",
        "venomous; he saw the great fangs, a foot long, curved like scimitars. From them dripped a colorless\n",
        "liquid that he instinctively knew was death. He might conceivably crush that wedge-shaped skull with a\n",

        "It was not because of any logical reasoning process that Conan remained motionless, since reason might\n",

        "A drop of venom fell on his naked thigh, and the feel of it was like a white-hot dagger driven into his\n",
        "flesh. Red jets of agony shot through Conan's brain, yet he held himself immovable; not by the twitching\n",

        "which stood so death-like still. Then suddenly, unexpectedly, the outer door, all but invisible in the\n",
        "shadows, clanged stridently. The serpent, suspicious as all its kind, whipped about with a quickness\n",

        "open and remained open. The grille was withdrawn and a huge dark figure was framed in the glow of\n",

        "moved into the light of the torch over Conan's head, the king saw that it was a gigantic black man, stark\n",
        "naked, bearing in one hand a huge sword and in the other a bunch of keys. The black spoke in a sea-coast\n",

        "tunnels. Not a sound came from the thick blubbery lips that flew wide in fleeting agony. With the thud of\n",
        "the stroke, Conan saw the life go out of the wide black eyes with the suddenness of a candle blown out.\n",
        "The blow knocked the great black body clear across the corridor and horribly the gigantic sinuous shape\n",
        "whipped around it in glistening coils that hid it from view, and the snap and splintering of bones came\n",
        "plainly to Conan's ears. Then something made his heart leap madly. The sword and the keys had flown\n",
        "from the black's hands to crash and jangle on the stone--and the keys lay almost at the king's feet.\n",
        "He tried to bend to them, but the chain was too short; almost suffocated by the mad pounding of his heart,\n",
        "he slipped one foot from its sandal, and gripped them with his toes; drawing his foot up, he grasped\n",
        "them fiercely, barely stifling the yell of ferocious exultation that rose instinctively to his lips.\n",
        "An instant's fumbling with the huge locks and he was free. He caught up the fallen sword and glared\n",
        "about. Only empty darkness met his eyes, into which the serpent had dragged a mangled, tattered object\n",
        "that only faintly resembled a human body. Conan turned to the open door. A few quick strides brought\n",
        "him to the threshold--a squeal of high-pitched laughter shrilled through the vaults, and the grille shot\n",
        "home under his very fingers, the bolt crashed down. Through the bars peered a face like a fiendishly\n",
        "mocking carven gargoyle--Shukeli the eunuch, who had followed his stolen keys. Surely he did not, in his\n",
        "gloating, see the sword in the prisoner's hand. With a terrible curse Conan struck as a cobra strikes; the\n",
        "great blade hissed between the bars and Shukeli's laughter broke in a death-scream. The fat eunuch bent\n",
        "at the middle, as if bowing to his killer, and crumpled like tallow, his pudgy hands clutching vainly at his\n",
        "spilling entrails.\n",
        "Conan snarled in savage satisfaction; but he was still a prisoner. His keys were futile against the bolt\n",
        "which could be worked only from the outside. His experienced touch told him the bars were hard as the\n",
        "sword; an attempt to hew his way to freedom would only splinter his one weapon. Yet he found dents on\n",
        "those adamantine bars, like the marks of incredible fangs, and wondered with an involuntary shudder\n",
        "what nameless monsters had so terribly assailed the barriers. Regardless, there was but one thing for him\n",
        "to do, and that was to seek some other outlet. Taking the torch from the niche, he set off down the\n",
        "corridor, sword in hand. He saw no sign of the serpent or its victim, only a great smear of blood on the\n",
        "stone floor.\n",
        "Darkness stalked on noiseless feet about him, scarcely driven back by his flickering torch. On either hand\n",
        "he saw dark openings, but he kept to the main corridor, watching the floor ahead of him carefully, lest he\n",
        "fall into some pit. And suddenly he heard the sound of a woman, weeping piteously. Another of Tsotha's\n",
        "victims, he thought, cursing the wizard anew, and turning aside, followed the sound down a smaller\n",
        "tunnel, dank and damp.\n",
        "The weeping grew nearer as he advanced, and lifting his torch he made out a vague shape in the shadows.\n",
        "Stepping closer, he halted in sudden horror at the amorphic bulk which sprawled before him. Its unstable\n",
        "outlines somewhat suggested an octopus, but its malformed tentacles were too short for its size, and its\n",
        "substance was a quaking, jelly-like stuff which made him physically sick to look at. From among this\n",
        "loathsome gelid mass reared up a frog-like head, and he was frozen with nauseated horror to realize that\n",
        "the sound of weeping was coming from those obscene blubbery lips. The noise changed to an abominable \n",
        "The Scarlet Citadel\n",
        "28\n",
        "high-pitched tittering as the great unstable eyes of the monstrosity rested on him, and it hitched its\n",
        "quaking bulk toward him. He backed away and fled up the tunnel, not trusting his sword. The creature\n",
        "might be composed of terrestrial matter, but it shook his very soul to look upon it, and he doubted the\n",
        "power of man-made weapons to harm it. For a short distance he heard it flopping and floundering after\n",
        "him, screaming with horrible laughter. The unmistakably human note in its mirth almost staggered his\n",
        "reason. It was exactly such laughter as he had heard bubble obscenely from the fat lips of the salacious\n",
        "women of Shadizar, City of Wickedness, when captive girls were stripped naked on the public auction\n",
        "block. By what hellish arts had Tsotha brought this unnatural being into life? Conan felt vaguely that he\n",
        "had looked on blasphemy against the eternal laws of nature.\n",
        "He ran toward the main corridor, but before he reached it he crossed a sort of small square chamber,\n",
        "where two tunnels crossed. As he reached this chamber, he was flashingly aware of some small squat\n",
        "bulk on the floor ahead of him; then before he could check his flight or swerve aside, his foot struck\n",
        "something yielding that squalled shrilly, and he was precipitated headlong, the torch flying from his\n",
        "hand and being extinguished as it struck the stone floor. Half stunned by his fall, Conan rose and groped\n",
        "in the darkness. His sense of direction was confused, and he was unable to decide in which direction lay\n",
        "the main corridor. He did not look for the torch, as he had no means of rekindling it. His groping hands\n",
        "found the openings of the tunnels, and he chose one at random. How long he traversed it in utter\n",
        "darkness, he never knew, but suddenly his barbarian's instinct of near peril halted him short.\n",
        "He had the same feeling he had had when standing on the brink of great precipices in the darkness.\n",
        "Dropping to all fours, he edged forward, and presently his outflung hand encountered the edge of a well,\n",
        "into which the tunnel floor dropped abruptly. As far down as he could reach the sides fell away sheerly,\n",
        "dank and slimy to his touch. He stretched out an arm in the darkness and could barely touch the opposite\n",
        "edge with the point of his sword. He could leap across it, then, but there was no point in that. He had\n",
        "taken the wrong tunnel and the main corridor lay somewhere behind him.\n",
        "Even as he thought this, he felt a faint movement of air; a shadowy wind, rising from the well, stirred his\n",
        "black mane. Conan's skin crawled. He tried to tell himself that this well connected somehow with the\n",
        "outer world, but his instincts told him it was a thing unnatural. He was not merely inside the hill; he was\n",
        "below it, far below the level of the city streets. How then could an outer wind find its way into the pits\n",
        "and blow up from below? A faint throbbing pulsed on that ghostly wind, like drums beating, far, far\n",
        "below. A strong shudder shook the king of Aquilonia.\n",
        "He rose to his feet and backed away, and as he did something floated up out of the well. What it was,\n",
        "Conan did not know. He could see nothing in the darkness, but he distinctly felt a presence--an invisible,\n",
        "intangible intelligence which hovered malignly near him. Turning, he fled the way he had come. Far\n",
        "ahead he saw a tiny red spark. He headed for it, and long before he thought to have reached it, he\n",
        "caromed headlong into a solid wall, and saw the spark at his feet. It was his torch, the flame extinguished,\n",
        "but the end a glowing coal. Carefully he took it up and blew upon it, fanning it into flame again. He gave\n",
        "a sigh as the tiny blaze leaped up. He was back in the chamber where the tunnels crossed, and his sense\n",
        "of direction came back.\n",
        "He located the tunnel by which he had left the main corridor, and even as he started toward it, his torch\n",
        "flame flickered wildly as if blown upon by unseen lips. Again he felt a presence, and he lifted his torch,\n",
        "glaring about.\n",
        "The Scarlet Citadel\n",
        "29\n",
        "He saw nothing; yet he sensed, somehow, an invisible, bodiless thing that hovered in the air, dripping\n",
        "slimily and mouthing obscenities that he could not hear but was in some instinctive way aware of. He\n",
        "swung viciously with his sword and it felt as if he were cleaving cobwebs. A cold horror shook him then,\n",
        "and he fled down the tunnel, feeling a foul burning breath on his naked back as he ran.\n",
        "But when he came out into the broad corridor, he was no longer aware of any presence, visible or\n",
        "invisible. Down it he went, momentarily expecting fanged and taloned fiends to leap at him from the\n",
        "darkness. The tunnels were not silent. From the bowels of the earth in all directions came sounds that did\n",
        "not belong in a sane world. There were titterings, squeals of demoniac mirth, long shuddering howls, and\n",
        "once the unmistakable squalling laughter of a hyena ended awfully in human words of shrieking\n",
        "blasphemy. He heard the pad of stealthy feet, and in the mouths of the tunnels caught glimpses of\n",
        "shadowy forms, monstrous and abnormal in outline.\n",
        "It was as if he had wandered into hell--a hell of Tsotha-lanti's making. But the shadowy things did not\n",
        "come into the great corridor, though he distinctly heard the greedy sucking-in of slavering lips, and felt\n",
        "the burning glare of hungry eyes. And presently he knew why. A slithering sound behind him electrified\n",
        "him, and he leaped to the darkness of a near-by tunnel, shaking out his torch. Down the corridor he heard\n",
        "the great serpent crawling, sluggish from its recent grisly meal. From his very side something whimpered\n",
        "in fear and slunk away in the darkness. Evidently the main corridor was the great snake's huntingground and the other monsters gave it room.\n",
        "To Conan the serpent was the least horror of them; he almost felt a kinship with it when he remembered\n",
        "the weeping, tittering obscenity, and the dripping, mouthing thing that came out of the well. At least it\n",
        "was of earthly matter; it was a crawling death, but it threatened only physical extinction, whereas these\n",
        "other horrors menaced mind and soul as well.\n",
        "After it had passed on down the corridor he followed, at what he hoped was a safe distance, blowing his\n",
        "torch into flame again. He had not gone far when he heard a low moan that seemed to emanate from the\n",
        "black entrance of a tunnel near by. Caution warned him on, but curiosity drove him to the tunnel,\n",
        "holding high the torch that was now little more than a stump. He was braced for the sight of anything,\n",
        "yet what he saw was what he had least expected. He was looking into a broad cell, and a space of this\n",
        "was caged off with closely set bars extending from floor to ceiling, set firmly in the stone. Within these\n",
        "bars lay a figure, which, as he approached, he saw was either a man, or the exact likeness of a man,\n",
        "twined and bound about with the tendrils of a thick vine which seemed to grow through the solid stone\n",
        "of the floor. It was covered with strangely pointed leaves and crimson blossoms--not the satiny red of\n",
        "natural petals, but a livid, unnatural crimson, like a perversity of flower-life. Its clinging, pliant branches\n",
        "wound about the man's naked body and limbs, seeming to caress his shrinking flesh with lustful avid\n",
        "kisses. One great blossom hovered exactly over his mouth. A low bestial moaning drooled from the loose\n",
        "lips; the head rolled as if in unbearable agony, and the eyes looked full at Conan. But there was no light of\n",
        "intelligence in them; they were blank, glassy, the eyes of an idiot.\n",
        "Now the great crimson blossom dipped and pressed its petals over the writhing lips. The limbs of the\n",
        "wretch twisted in anguish; the tendrils of the plant quivered as if in ecstasy, vibrating their full snaky\n",
        "lengths. Waves of changing hues surged over them; their color grew deeper, more venomous.\n",
        "The Scarlet Citadel\n",
        "30\n",
        "Conan did not understand what he saw, but he knew that he looked on Horror of some kind. Man or\n",
        "demon, the suffering of the captive touched Conan's wayward and impulsive heart. He sought for\n",
        "entrance and found a grille-like door in the bars, fastened with a heavy lock, for which he found a key\n",
        "among the keys he carried, and entered. Instantly the petals of the livid blossoms spread like the hood of\n",
        "a cobra, the tendrils reared menacingly and the whole plant shook and swayed toward him. Here was no\n",
        "blind growth of natural vegetation. Conan sensed a malignant intelligence; the plant could see him, and\n",
        "he felt its hate emanate from it in almost tangible waves. Stepping warily nearer, he marked the root-stem,\n",
        "a repulsively supple stalk thicker than his thigh, and even as the long tendrils arched toward him with a\n",
        "rattle of leaves and hiss, he swung his sword and cut through the stem with a single stroke.\n",
        "Instantly the wretch in its clutches was thrown violently aside as the great vine lashed and knotted like a\n",
        "beheaded serpent, rolling into a huge irregular ball. The tendrils thrashed and writhed, the leaves shook\n",
        "and rattled like castanets, and the petals opened and closed convulsively; then the whole length\n",
        "straightened out limply, the vivid colors paled and dimmed, a reeking white liquid oozed from the\n",
        "severed stump.\n",
        "Conan stared, spellbound; then a sound brought him round, sword lifted. The freed man was on his feet,\n",
        "surveying him. Conan gaped in wonder. No longer were the eyes in the worn face expressionless. Dark\n",
        "and meditative, they were alive with intelligence, and the expression of imbecility had dropped from the\n",
        "face like a mask. The head was narrow and well-formed, with a high splendid forehead. The whole build\n",
        "of the man was aristocratic, evident no less in his tall slender frame than in his small trim feet and hands.\n",
        "His first words were strange and startling.\n",
        "\"What year is this?\" he asked, speaking Kothic.\n",
        "\"Today is the tenth day of the month Yuluk, of the year of the Gazelle,\" answered Conan.\n",
        "\"Yagkoolan Ishtar!\" murmured the stranger. \"Ten years!\" He drew a hand across his brow, shaking his\n",
        "head as if to clear his brain of cobwebs. \"All is dim yet. After a ten-year emptiness, the mind can not be\n",
        "expected to begin functioning clearly at once. Who are you?\"\n",
        "\"Conan, once of Cimmeria. Now king of Aquilonia.\"\n",
        "The other's eyes showed surprize.\n",
        "\"Indeed? And Namedides?\"\n",
        "\"I strangled him on his throne the night I took the royal city,\" answered Conan.\n",
        "A certain naivete in the king's reply twitched the stranger's lips.\n",
        "\"Pardon, your majesty. I should have thanked you for the service you have done me. I am like a man\n",
        "woken suddenly from sleep deeper than death and shot with nightmares of agony more fierce than hell,\n",
        "but I understand that you delivered me. Tell me--why did you cut the stem of the plant Yothga instead of\n",
        "tearing it up by the roots?\"\n",
        "\"Because I learned long ago to avoid touching with my flesh that which I do not understand,\" answered\n",
        "the Cimmerian.\n",
        "The Scarlet Citadel\n",
        "31\n",
        "\"Well for you,\" said the stranger. \"Had you been able to tear it up, you might have found things clinging\n",
        "to the roots against which not even your sword would prevail. Yothga's roots are set in hell.\"\n",
        "\"But who are you?\" demanded Conan.\n",
        "\"Men called me Pelias.\"\n",
        "\"What!\" cried the king. \"Pelias the sorcerer, Tsotha-lanti's rival, who vanished from the earth ten years\n",
        "ago?\"\n",
        "\"Not entirely from the earth,\" answered Pelias with a wry smile. \"Tsotha preferred to keep me alive, in\n",
        "shackles more grim than rusted iron. He pent me in here with this devil-flower whose seeds drifted down\n",
        "through the black cosmos from Yag the Accursed, and found fertile field only in the maggot-writhing\n",
        "corruption that seethes on the floors of hell.\n",
        "\"I could not remember my sorcery and the words and symbols of my power, with that cursed thing\n",
        "gripping me and drinking my soul with its loathsome caresses. It sucked the contents of my mind day\n",
        "and night, leaving my brain as empty as a broken wine-jug. Ten years! Ishtar preserve us!\"\n",
        "Conan found no reply, but stood holding the stump of the torch, and trailing his great sword. Surely the\n",
        "man was mad--yet there was no madness in the dark eyes that rested so calmly on him.\n",
        "\"Tell me, is the black wizard in Khorshemish? But no--you need not reply. My powers begin to wake, and\n",
        "I sense in your mind a great battle and a king trapped by treachery. And I see Tsotha-lanti riding hard for\n",
        "the Tybor with Strabonus and the king of Ophir. So much the better. My art is too frail from the long\n",
        "slumber to face Tsotha yet. I need time to recruit my strength, to assemble my powers. Let us go forth\n",
        "from these pits.\"\n",
        "Conan jangled his keys discouragedly.\n",
        "\"The grille to the outer door is made fast by a bolt which can be worked only from the outside. Is there no\n",
        "other exit from these tunnels?\"\n",
        "\"Only one, which neither of us would care to use, seeing that it goes down and not up,\" laughed Pelias.\n",
        "\"But no matter. Let us see to the grille.\"\n",
        "He moved toward the corridor with uncertain steps, as of long-unused limbs, which gradually became\n",
        "more sure. As he followed Conan remarked uneasily, \"There is a cursed big snake creeping about this\n",
        "tunnel. Let us be wary lest we step into his mouth.\"\n",
        "\"I remember him of old,\" answered Pelias grimly, \"the more as I was forced to watch while ten of my\n",
        "acolytes were fed to him. He is Satha, the Old One, chiefest of Tsotha's pets.\"\n",
        "\"Did Tsotha dig these pits for no other reason than to house his cursed monstrosities?\" asked Conan.\n",
        "\"He did not dig them. when the city was founded three thousand years ago there were ruins of an earlier\n",
        "city on and about this hill. King Khossus V, the founder, built his palace on the hill, and digging cellars\n",
        "beneath it, came upon a walled-up doorway, which he broke into and discovered the pits, which were \n",
        "The Scarlet Citadel\n",
        "32\n",
        "about as we see them now. But his grand vizier came to such a grisly end in them that Khossus in a fright\n",
        "walled up the entrance again. He said the vizier fell into a well--but he had the cellars filled in, and later\n",
        "abandoned the palace itself, and built himself another in the suburbs, from which he fled in a panic on\n",
        "discovering some black mold scattered on the marble floor of his palace one morning.\n",
        "\"He then departed with his whole court to the eastern corner of the kingdom and built a new city. The\n",
        "palace on the hill was not used and fell into ruins. When Akkutho I revived the lost glories of\n",
        "Khorshemish, he built a fortress there. It remained for Tsotha-lanti to rear the scarlet citadel and open the\n",
        "way to the pits again. Whatever fate overtook the grand vizier of Khossus, Tsotha avoided it. He fell into\n",
        "no well, though he did descend into a well he found, and came out with a strange expression which has\n",
        "not since left his eyes.\n",
        "\"I have seen that well, but I do not care to seek in it for wisdom. I am a sorcerer, and older than men\n",
        "reckon, but I am human. As for Tsotha--men say that a dancing-girl of Shadizar slept too near the prehuman ruins on Dagoth Hill and woke in the grip of a black demon; from that unholy union was\n",
        "spawned an accursed hybrid men call Tsotha-lanti--\"\n",
        "Conan cried out sharply and recoiled, thrusting his companion back. Before them rose the great\n",

        "out in a glitter of pure fear--the only time Conan ever saw such an expression in a reptile's eyes. With a\n",

        "An icy trickle disturbed Conan's spine, and he wondered if, after all, Pelias were a man, or merely\n",

        "\"By the ivory hips of Ishtar, who is our doorman? Lo, it is no less than the noble Shukeli, who hanged my\n",
        "young men by their feet and skinned them with squeals of laughter! Do you sleep, Shukeli? Why do you\n",
        "lie so stiffly, with your fat belly sunk in like a dressed pig's?\"\n",
        "\"He is dead,\" muttered Conan, ill at ease to hear these wild words.\n",

        "water; for Shukeli's wide-open eyes were glassy and empty, and from the great gash in his belly his\n",
        "entrails hung limply to the floor. The eunuch's feet stumbled among his entrails as he worked the bolt,\n",

        "notice the strong shudder which shook Conan's mighty frame.\n",
        "He led the way up the long stairs, and through the skull-crowned brass door at the top. Conan gripped\n",
        "his sword, expecting a rush of slaves, but silence gripped the citadel. They passed through the black\n",
        "corridor and came into that in which the censers swung, billowing forth their everlasting incense. Still\n",
        "they saw no one.\n",
        "\"The slaves and soldiers are quartered in another part of the citadel,\" remarked Pelias. \"Tonight, their\n",
        "master being away, they doubtless lie drunk on wine or lotus-juice.\"\n",
        "Conan glanced through an arched, golden-silled window that let out upon a broad balcony, and swore in\n",
        "surprize to see the dark-blue star-flecked sky. It had been shortly after sunrise when he was thrown into\n",
        "the pits. Now it was past midnight. He could scarcely realize he had been so long underground. He was\n",
        "suddenly aware of thirst and a ravenous appetite. Pelias led the way into a gold-domed chamber, floored\n",
        "with silver, its lapis-lazuli walls pierced by the fretted arches of many doors.\n",
        "With a sigh Pelias sank onto a silken divan.\n",
        "\"Gold and silks again,\" he sighed. \"Tsotha affects to be above the pleasures of the flesh, but he is half devil.\n",
        "I am human, despite my black arts. I love ease and good cheer--that's how Tsotha trapped me. He caught\n",
        "me helpless with drink. Wine is a curse--by the ivory bosom of Ishtar, even as I speak of it, the traitor is\n",
        "here! Friend, please pour me a goblet--hold! I forgot that you are a king. I will pour.\"\n",
        "\"The devil with that,\" growled Conan, filling a crystal goblet and proffering it to Pelias. Then, lifting the\n",
        "jug, he drank deeply from the mouth, echoing Pelias' sigh of satisfaction.\n",
        "\"The dog knows good wine,\" said Conan, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. \"But by Crom,\n",
        "Pelias, are we to sit here until his soldiers awake and cut our throats?\"\n",
        "The Scarlet Citadel\n",
        "34\n",
        "\"No fear,\" answered Pelias. \"Would you like to see how fortune holds with Strabonus?\"\n",
        "Blue fire burned in Conan's eyes, and he gripped his sword until his knuckles showed blue. \"Oh, to be at\n",
        "sword-points with him!\" he rumbled.\n",
        "Pelias lifted a great shimmering globe from an ebony table.\n",
        "\"Tsotha's crystal. A childish toy, but useful when there is lack of time for higher science. Look in, your\n",
        "majesty.\"\n",
        "He laid it on the table before Conan's eyes. The king looked into cloudy depths which deepened and\n",
        "expanded. Slowly images crystallized out of mist and shadows. He was looking on a familiar landscape.\n",
        "Broad plains ran to a wide winding river, beyond which the level lands ran up quickly into a maze of low\n",
        "hills. On the northern bank of the river stood a walled town, guarded by a moat connected at each end\n",
        "with the river.\n",
        "\"By Crom!\" ejaculated Conan. \"It's Shamar! The dogs besiege it!\"\n",
        "The invaders had crossed the river; their pavilions stood in the narrow plain between the city and the\n",
        "hills. Their warriors swarmed about the walls, their mail gleaming palely under the moon. Arrows and\n",
        "stones rained on them from the towers and they staggered back, but came on again.\n",
        "Even as Conan cursed, the scene changed. Tall spires and gleaming domes stood up in the mist, and he\n",
        "looked on his own capital of Tamar, where all was confusion. He saw the steel-clad knights of Poitain, his\n",
        "staunchest supporters, riding out of the gate, hooted and hissed by the multitude which swarmed the\n",
        "streets. He saw looting and rioting, and men-at-arms whose shields bore the insignia of Pellia, manning\n",
        "the towers and swaggering through the markets. Over all, like a fantasmal mirage, he saw the dark,\n",
        "triumphant face of Prince Arpello of Pellia. The images faded.\n",
        "\"So!\" raved Conan. \"My people turn on me the moment my back is turned--\"\n",
        "\"Not entirely,\" broke in Pelias. \"They have heard that you are dead. There is no one to protect them from\n",
        "outer enemies and civil war, they think. Naturally, they turn to the strongest noble, to avoid the horrors\n",
        "of anarchy. They do not trust the Poitanians, remembering former wars. But Arpello is on hand, and the\n",
        "strongest prince of the central provinces.\"\n",
        "\"When I come to Aquilonia again he will be but a headless corpse rotting on Traitor's Common,\" Conan\n",
        "ground his teeth.\n",
        "\"Yet before you can reach your capital,\" reminded Pelias, \"Strabonus may be before you. At least his\n",
        "riders will be ravaging your kingdom.\"\n",
        "\"True!\" Conan paced the chamber like a caged lion. \"With the fastest horse I could not reach Shamar\n",
        "before midday. Even there I could do no good except to die with the people, when the town falls--as fall it\n",
        "will in a few days at most. From Shamar to Tamar is five days' ride, even if you kill your horses on the\n",
        "road. Before I could reach my capital and raise an army, Strabonus would be hammering at the gates;\n",
        "because raising an army is going to be hell--all my damnable nobles will have scattered to their own\n",
        "cursed fiefs at the word of my death. And since the people have driven out Trocero of Poitain, there's \n",
        "The Scarlet Citadel\n",
        "35\n",
        "none to keep Arpello's greedy hands off the crown--and the crown-treasure. He'll hand the country over\n",
        "to Strabonus, in return for a mock-throne--and as soon as Strabonus' back is turned, he'll stir up revolt.\n",
        "But the nobles won't support him, and it will only give Strabonus excuse for annexing the kingdom\n",
        "openly. Oh Crom, Ymir, and Set! If I but had wings to fly like lightning to Tamar!\"\n",
        "Pelias, who sat tapping the jade table-top with his finger-nails, halted suddenly, and rose as with a\n",
        "definite purpose, beckoning Conan to follow. The king complied, sunk in moody thoughts, and Pelias led\n",
        "the way out of the chamber and up a flight of marble, gold-worked stairs that let out on the pinnacle of\n",
        "the citadel, the roof of the tallest tower. It was night, and a strong wind was blowing through the starfilled skies, stirring Conan's black mane. Far below them twinkled the lights of Khorshemish, seemingly\n",
        "farther away than the stars above them. Pelias seemed withdrawn and aloof here, one in cold unhuman\n",
        "greatness with the company of the stars.\n",
        "\"There are creatures,\" said Pelias, \"not alone of earth and sea, but of air and the far reaches of the skies as\n",
        "well, dwelling apart, unguessed of men. Yet to him who holds the Master-words and Signs and the\n",
        "Knowledge underlying all, they are not malignant nor inaccessible. Watch, and fear not.\"\n",
        "He lifted his hands to the skies and sounded a long weird call that seemed to shudder endlessly out into\n",
        "space, dwindling and fading, yet never dying out, only receding farther and farther into some\n",
        "unreckoned cosmos. In the silence that followed, Conan heard a sudden beat of wings in the stars, and\n",
        "recoiled as a huge bat-like creature alighted beside him. He saw its great calm eyes regarding him in the\n",
        "starlight; he saw the forty-foot spread of its giant wings. And he saw it was neither bat nor bird.\n",
        "\"Mount and ride,\" said Pelias. \"By dawn it will bring you to Tamar.\"\n",
        "\"By Crom!\" muttered Conan. \"Is this all a nightmare from which I shall presently awaken in my palace at\n",
        "Tamar? What of you? I would not leave you alone among your enemies.\"\n",
        "\"Be at ease regarding me,\" answered Pelias. \"At dawn the people of Khorshemish will know they have a\n",
        "new master. Doubt not what the gods have sent you. I will meet you in the plain by Shamar.\"\n",
        "Doubtfully Conan clambered upon the ridged back, gripping the arched neck, still convinced that he was\n",
        "in the grasp of a fantastic nightmare. With a great rush and thunder of titan wings, the creature took the\n",

        "By means known only to Tsotha-lanti, word had reached Tamar of the king's death, within half a dozen\n",
        "hours after the battle. Chaos had resulted. The barons had deserted the royal capital, galloping away to\n",

        "36\n",
        "tottering on the edge of dissolution, and commoners and merchants trembled at the imminence of a\n",

        "them, but in their unreasoning terror they remembered old civil wars, and how this same count had\n",
        "besieged Tamar fifteen years before. It was shouted in the streets that Trocero had betrayed the king; that\n",

        "Trocero swept down on the looters, littered the streets with their corpses, drove them back into their\n",

        "Prince Arpello came before the distracted council and announced himself ready to take over the\n",

        "surrendered.\n",
        "Trocero at first refused the order to give up his baton of authority, but the people swarmed about him,\n",

        "hanged the leaders of the mercenaries in the market-square as his last official act, and rode out of the\n",

        "from the sight.\n",
        "\"Here is sorcery!\" screamed Tsotha, clawing madly at his beard. \"How could he have escaped and\n",
        "reached his kingdom in time to return with an army so quickly? This is the work of Pelias, curse him! I\n",
        "feel his hand in this! May I be cursed for not killing him when I had the power!\"\n",
        "The kings gaped at the mention of a man they believed ten years dead, and panic, emanating from the\n",
        "leaders, shook the host. All recognized the rider on the black stallion. Tsotha felt the superstitious dread\n",
        "of his men, and fury made a hellish mask of his face.\n",
        "\"Strike home!\" he screamed, brandishing his lean arms madly. \"We are still the stronger! Charge and\n",
        "crush these dogs! We shall yet feast in the ruins of Shamar tonight! Oh, Set!\" he lifted his hands and\n",

        "beaten the frothing mob away from the Pellian soldiers who held the outer walls of Tamar, and\n",
        "impressed them into his service. He had sent a swift rider after Trocero to bring him back. With these as a\n",
        "nucleus of an army he had raced southward, sweeping the countryside for recruits and for mounts.\n",
        "Nobles of Tamar and the surrounding countryside had augmented his forces, and he had levied recruits\n",

        "Nineteen hundred armored horsemen followed him, the main bulk of which consisted of the Poitanian\n",

        "powers of the rescuers. First marched the Shemitish archers, then the Kothian spearmen, then the mailed\n",
        "knights of Strabonus and Amalrus. Arbanus' intent was obvious--to employ his footmen to sweep away\n",
        "the infantry of Conan, and open the way for an overpowering charge of his heavy cavalry.\n",
        "The Shemites opened fire at five hundred yards, and arrows flew like hail between the hosts, darkening\n",
        "the sun. The western archers, trained by a thousand years of merciless warfare with the Pictish savages,\n",
        "came stolidly on, closing their ranks as their comrades fell. They were far outnumbered, and the\n",

        "balanced sheer skill in archery by superiority in morale, and in excellency of armor. Within good range\n",

        "was but a day's ride across the Bossonian marches from the borders of Cimmeria, and who, born and\n",
        "bred to battle, were the purest blood of all the Hyborian peoples. The Kothian spearmen, dazed by their\n",

        "they would ride among the Bossonians and cut them down like corn; but flesh and blood could not\n",

        "The whole front rank of the knights melted away, and over the pin-cushioned corpses of horses and\n",

        "and into the heart of their host rode the knights of Poitain, swinging their terrible two-handed swords.\n",
        "The clash and clangor of steel was as that of a million sledges on as many anvils. The watchers on the\n",
        "walls were stunned and deafened by the thunder as they gripped the battlements and watched the steel\n",

        "thunderbolt strikes, Conan struck, hurtling through the ranks by sheer power and velocity, until he came\n",
        "to Strabonus, livid among his palace troops. Now here the battle hung in balance, for with his superior\n",
        "numbers, Strabonus still had opportunity to pluck victory from the knees of the gods.\n",
        "But he screamed when he saw his arch-foe within arm's length at last, and lashed out wildly with his axe.\n",
        "It clanged on Conan's helmet, striking fire, and the Cimmerian reeled and struck back. The five-foot blade\n",
        "crushed Strabonus' casque and skull, and the king's charger reared screaming, hurling a limp and\n",
        "sprawling corpse from the saddle. A great cry went up from the host, which faltered and gave back.\n",
        "Trocero and his house troops, hewing desperately, cut their way to Conan's side, and the great banner of\n",
        "Koth went down. Then behind the dazed and stricken invaders went up a mighty clamor and the blaze of\n",
        "a huge conflagration. The defenders of Shamar had made a desperate sortie, cut down the men masking\n",
        "the gates, and were raging among the tents of the besiegers, cutting down the camp followers, burning\n",
        "the pavilions, and destroying the siege engines. It was the last straw. The gleaming army melted away in\n",
        "flight, and the furious conquerors cut them down as they ran.\n",
        "The fugitives raced for the river, but the men on the flotilla, harried sorely by the stones and shafts of the\n",
        "revived citizens, cast loose and pulled for the southern shore, leaving their comrades to their fate. Of\n",
        "these many gained the shore, racing across the barges that served as a bridge, until the men of Shamar cut\n",
        "these adrift and severed them from the shore. Then the fight became a slaughter. Driven into the river to\n",
        "drown in their armor, or hacked down along the bank, the invaders perished by the thousands. No\n",
        "quarter they had promised; no quarter they got.\n",
        "From the foot of the low hills to the shores of the Tybor, the plain was littered with corpses, and the river\n",
        "whose tide ran red, floated thick with the dead. Of the nineteen hundred knights who had ridden south\n",
        "with Conan, scarcely five hundred lived to boast of their scars, and the slaughter among the archers and\n",
        "pikemen was ghastly. But the great and shining host of Strabonus and Amalrus was hacked out of\n",
        "existence, and those that fled were less than those that died.\n",
        "While the slaughter yet went on along the river, the final act of a grim drama was being played out in the\n",

        "Ruthlessly riding down friend and foe, he gained the southern bank, and then a glance backward showed\n",
        "him a grim figure on a great black stallion in pursuit. The lashings had already been cut, and the barges\n",
        "were drifting apart, but Conan came recklessly on, leaping his steed from boat to boat as a man might \n",
        "The Scarlet Citadel\n",
        "43\n",

        "with crimson drops.\n",
        "On they fled, the hunted and the hunter, and not a foot could the black stallion gain, though he strained\n",
        "each nerve and thew. Through a sunset land of dim and illusive shadows they fled, till sight and sound of\n",
        "the slaughter died out behind them. Then in the sky appeared a dot, that grew into a huge eagle as it\n",
        "approached. Swooping down from the sky, it drove at the head of Tsotha's steed, which screamed and\n",
        "reared, throwing its rider.\n",
        "Old Tsotha rose and faced his pursuer, his eyes those of a maddened serpent, his face an inhuman mask.\n",
        "In each hand he held something that shimmered, and Conan knew he held death there.\n",
        "The king dismounted and strode toward his foe, his armor clanking, his great sword gripped high.\n",
        "\"Again we meet, wizard!\" he grinned savagely.\n",
        "\"Keep off\" screamed Tsotha like a blood-mad jackal. \"I'll blast the flesh from your bones! You can not\n",
        "conquer me--if you hack me in pieces, the bits of flesh and bone will reunite and haunt you to your doom!\n",
        "I see the hand of Pelias in this, but I defy ye both! I am Tsotha, son of--\"\n",
        "Conan rushed, sword gleaming, eyes slits of wariness. Tsotha's right hand came back and forward, and\n",
        "the king ducked quickly. Something passed by his helmeted head and exploded behind him, searing the\n",
        "very sands with a flash of hellish fire. Before Tsotha could toss the globe in his left hand, Conan's sword\n",
        "sheared through his lean neck. The wizard's head shot from his shoulders on an arching fount of blood,\n",
        "and the robed figure staggered and crumpled drunkenly. Yet the mad black eyes glared up at Conan with\n",
        "no dimming of their feral light, the lips writhed awfully, and the hands groped, as if searching for the\n",
        "severed head. Then with a swift rush of wings, something swooped from the sky--the eagle which had\n",
        "attacked Tsotha's horse. In its mighty talons it snatched up the dripping head and soared skyward, and\n",
        "Conan stood struck dumb, for from the eagle's throat boomed human laughter, in the voice of Pelias the\n",
        "sorcerer.\n",
        "Then a hideous thing came to pass, for the headless body reared up from the sand, and staggered away in\n",
        "awful flight on stiffening legs, hands blindly outstretched toward the dot speeding and dwindling in the\n",
        "dusky sky. Conan stood like one turned to stone, watching until the swift reeling figure faded in the dusk\n",
        "that purpled the meadows.\n",
        "\"Crom!\" his mighty shoulders twitched. \"A murrain on these wizardly feuds! Pelias has dealt well with\n",

        "most of the guests had gone out by doors and broken windows, and the rest huddled behind stacks of\n",
        "wine-kegs and under tables. The barbarian was gone; the center of the room was deserted except for the\n",
        "gashed body of the Kothian. The Cimmerian, with the unerring instinct of the barbarian, had killed his\n",
        "man in the darkness and confusion.\n",
        "The lurid lights and drunken revelry fell away behind the Cimmerian. He had discarded his torn tunic,\n",
        "and walked through the night naked except for a loin-cloth and his high-strapped sandals. He moved\n",
        "with the supple ease of a great tiger, his steely muscles rippling under his brown skin.\n",
        "He had entered the part of the city reserved for the temples. On all sides of him they glittered white in the\n",
        "starlight--snowy marble pillars and golden domes and silver arches, shrines of Zamora's myriad strange\n",
        "gods. He did not trouble his head about them; he knew that Zamora's religion, like all things of a civilized,\n",
        "long-settled people, was intricate and complex, and had lost most of the pristine essence in a maze of\n",
        "formulas and rituals. He had squatted for hours in the courtyard of the philosophers, listening to the\n",
        "arguments of theologians and teachers, and come away in a haze of bewilderment, sure of only one thing,\n",
        "and that, that they were all touched in the head.\n",
        "His gods were simple and understandable; Crom was their chief, and he lived on a great mountain,\n",
        "whence he sent forth dooms and death. It was useless to call on Crom, because he was a gloomy, savage\n",
        "god, and he hated weaklings. But he gave a man courage at birth, and the will and might to kill his\n",
        "enemies, which, in the Cimmerian's mind, was all any god should be expected to do.\n",
        "His sandalled feet made no sound on the gleaming pave. No watchmen passed, for even the thieves of\n",
        "the Maul shunned the temples, where strange dooms had been known to fall on violators. Ahead of him\n",
        "he saw, looming against the sky, the Tower of the Elephant. He mused, wondering why it was so named.\n",
        "No one seemed to know. He had never seen an elephant, but he vaguely understood that it was a\n",
        "monstrous animal, with a tail in front as well as behind. This a wandering Shemite had told him, \n",
        "The Tower of the Elephant\n",
        "47\n",
        "swearing that he had seen such beasts by the thousands in the country of the Hyrkanians; but all men\n",
        "knew what liars were the men of Shem. At any rate, there were no elephants in Zamora.\n",
        "The shimmering shaft of the tower rose frostily in the stars. In the sunlight it shone so dazzlingly that few\n",
        "could bear its glare, and men said it was built of silver. It was round, a slim perfect cylinder, a hundred\n",
        "and fifty feet in height, and its rim glittered in the starlight with the great jewels which crusted it. The\n",
        "tower stood among the waving exotic trees of a garden raised high above the general level of the city. A\n",
        "high wall enclosed this garden, and outside the wall was a lower level, likewise enclosed by a wall. No\n",
        "lights shone forth; there seemed to be no windows in the tower--at least not above the level of the inner\n",
        "wall. Only the gems high above sparkled frostily in the starlight.\n",
        "Shrubbery grew thick outside the lower, or outer wall. The Cimmerian crept close and stood beside the\n",
        "barrier, measuring it with his eyes. It was high, but he could leap and catch the coping with his fingers.\n",
        "Then it would be child's play to swing himself up and over, and he did not doubt that he could pass the\n",
        "inner wall in the same manner. But he hesitated at the thought of the strange perils which were said to\n",
        "await within. These people were strange and mysterious to him; they were not of his kind--not even of\n",
        "the same blood as the more westerly Brythunians, Nemedians, Kothians and Aquilonians, whose\n",
        "civilized mysteries had awed him in times past. The people of Zamora were very ancient, and, from what\n",
        "he had seen of them, very evil.\n",
        "He thought of Yara, the high priest, who worked strange dooms from this jeweled tower, and the\n",
        "Cimmerian's hair prickled as he remembered a tale told by a drunken page of the court--how Yara had\n",
        "laughed in the face of a hostile prince, and held up a glowing, evil gem before him, and how rays shot\n",
        "blindingly from that unholy jewel, to envelop the prince, who screamed and fell down, and shrank to a\n",
        "withered blackened lump that changed to a black spider which scampered wildly about the chamber\n",
        "until Yara set his heel upon it.\n",
        "Yara came not often from his tower of magic, and always to work evil on some man or some nation. The\n",
        "king of Zamora feared him more than he feared death, and kept himself drunk all the time because that\n",
        "fear was more than he could endure sober. Yara was very old--centuries old, men said, and added that he\n",
        "would live for ever because of the magic of his gem, which men called the Heart of the Elephant, for no\n",
        "better reason than they named his hold the Elephant's Tower.\n",
        "The Cimmerian, engrossed in these thoughts, shrank quickly against the wall. Within the garden\n",
        "someone was passing, who walked with a measured stride. The listener heard the clink of steel. So after\n",
        "all a guard did pace those gardens. The Cimmerian waited, expected to hear him pass again, on the next\n",
        "round, but silence rested over the mysterious gardens.\n",
        "At last curiosity overcame him. Leaping lightly he grasped the wall and swung himself up to the top with\n",
        "one arm. Lying flat on the broad coping, he looked down into the wide space between the walls. No\n",
        "shrubbery grew near him, though he saw some carefully trimmed bushes near the inner wall. The\n",
        "starlight fell on the even sward and somewhere a fountain tinkled.\n",
        "The Cimmerian cautiously lowered himself down on the inside and drew his sword, staring about him.\n",
        "He was shaken by the nervousness of the wild at standing thus unprotected in the naked starlight, and he\n",
        "moved lightly around the curve of the wall, hugging its shadow, until he was even with the shrubbery he \n",
        "The Tower of the Elephant\n",
        "48\n",
        "had noticed. Then he ran quickly toward it, crouching low, and almost tripped over a form that lay\n",
        "crumpled near the edges of the bushes.\n",
        "A quick look to right and left showed him no enemy in sight at least, and he bent close to investigate. His\n",
        "keen eyes, even in the dim starlight, showed him a strongly built man in the silvered armor and crested\n",
        "helmet of the Zamorian royal guard. A shield and a spear lay near him, and it took but an instant's\n",
        "examination to show that he had been strangled. The barbarian glanced about uneasily. He knew that this\n",
        "man must be the guard he had heard pass his hiding-place by the wall. Only a short time had passed, yet\n",
        "in that interval nameless hands had reached out of the dark and choked out the soldier's life.\n",
        "Straining his eyes in the gloom, he saw a hint of motion through the shrubs near the wall. Thither he\n",
        "glided, gripping his sword. He made no more noise than a panther stealing through the night, yet the\n",
        "man he was stalking heard. The Cimmerian had a dim glimpse of a huge bulk close to the wall felt relief\n",
        "that it was at least human; then the fellow wheeled quickly with a gasp that sounded like panic, made the\n",
        "first motion of a forward plunge, hands clutching, then recoiled as the Cimmerian's blade caught the\n",
        "starlight. For a tense instant neither spoke, standing ready for anything.\n",
        "'You are no soldier,' hissed the stranger at last. 'You are a thief like myself.'\n",
        "'And who are you?' asked the Cimmerian in a suspicious whisper.\n",
        "'Taurus of Nemedia.' The Cimmerian lowered his sword. 'I've heard of you. Men call you a prince of\n",
        "thieves.' A low laugh answered him. Taurus was tall as the Cimmerian, and heavier; he was big-bellied\n",
        "and fat, but his every movement betokened a subtle dynamic magnetism, which was reflected in the keen\n",
        "eyes that glinted vitally, even in the starlight. He was barefooted and carried a coil of what looked like a\n",
        "thin, strong rope, knotted at regular intervals. 'Who are you?' he whispered.\n",
        "'Conan, a Cimmerian,' answered the other. 'I came seeking a way to steal Yara's jewel, that men call the\n",
        "Elephant's Heart.'\n",
        "Conan sensed the man's great belly shaking in laughter, but it was not derisive.\n",
        "'By Bel, god of thieves!' hissed Taurus. 'I had thought only myself had courage to attempt that poaching.\n",
        "These Zamorians call themselves thieves--bah! Conan, I like your grit. I never shared an adventure with\n",
        "anyone, but by Bel, we'll attempt this together if you're willing.'\n",
        "'Then you are after the gem, too?'\n",
        "'What else? I've had my plans laid for months, but you, I think, have acted on a sudden impulse, my\n",
        "friend.' 'You killed the soldier?'\n",
        "'Of course. I slid over the wall when he was on the other side of the garden. I hid in the bushes; he heard\n",
        "me, or thought he heard something. When he came blundering over, it was no trick at all to get behind\n",
        "him and suddenly grip his neck and choke out his fool's life. He was like most men, half blind in the dark.\n",
        "A good thief should have eyes like a cat.'\n",
        "'You made one mistake,' said Conan.\n",
        "Taurus's eyes flashed angrily.\n",
        "The Tower of the Elephant\n",
        "49\n",
        "'I? I, a mistake? Impossible!'\n",
        "'You should have dragged the body into the bushes.'\n",
        "'Said the novice to the master of the art. They will not change the guard until past midnight. Should any\n",
        "come searching for him now, and find his body, they would flee at once to Yara, bellowing the news, and\n",
        "give us time to escape. Were they not to find it, they'd go on beating up the bushes and catch us like rats\n",
        "in a trap.'\n",
        "'You are right,' agreed Conan.\n",
        "'So. Now attend. We waste time in this cursed discussion. There are no guards in the inner garden--\n",
        "human guards, I mean, though there are sentinels even more deadly. It was their presence which baffled\n",
        "me for so long, but I finally discovered a way to circumvent them.'\n",
        "'What of the soldiers in the lower part of the tower?'\n",
        "'Old Yara dwells in the chambers above. By that route we will come--and go, I hope. Never mind asking\n",
        "me how. I have arranged a way. We'll steal down through the top of the tower and strangle old Yara\n",
        "before he can cast any of his accursed spells on us. At least we'll try; it's the chance of being turned into a\n",
        "spider or a toad, against the wealth and power of the world. All good thieves must know how to take\n",
        "risks.'\n",
        "'I'll go as far as any man,' said Conan, slipping off his sandals.\n",
        "'Then follow me.' And turning, Taurus leaped up, caught the wall and drew himself up. The man's\n",
        "suppleness was amazing, considering his bulk; he seemed almost to glide up over the edge of the coping.\n",
        "Conan followed him, and lying flat on the broad top, they spoke in wary whispers.\n",
        "'I see no light,' Conan muttered. The lower part of the tower seemed much like that portion visible from\n",
        "outside the garden--a perfect, gleaming cylinder, with no apparent openings.\n",
        "'There are cleverly constructed doors and windows,' answered Taurus, 'but they are closed. The soldiers\n",
        "breathe air that comes from above.'\n",
        "The garden was a vague pool of shadows, where feadiery bushes and low spreading trees waved darkly\n",
        "in the starlight. Conan's wary soul felt the aura of waiting menace that brooded over it. He felt the\n",
        "burning glare of unseen eyes, and he caught a subde scent that made the short hairs on his neck\n",
        "instinctively brisde as a hunting dog brisdes at the scent of an ancient enemy. 'Follow me,' whispered\n",
        "Taurus, 'keep behind me, as you value your life.'\n",
        "Taking what looked like a copper tube from his girdle, the Nemedian dropped lighdy to the sward inside\n",
        "the wall. Conan was close behind him, sword ready, but Taurus pushed him back, close to the wall, and\n",
        "showed no indication to advance, himself. His whole attitude was of tense expectancy, and his gaze, like\n",
        "Conan's, was fixed on the shadowy mass of shrubbery a few yards away. This shrubbery was shaken,\n",
        "although the breeze had thed down. Then two great eyes blazed from the waving shadows, and behind\n",
        "them other sparks of fire glinted in the darkness.\n",
        "'Lions!' muttered Conan.\n",
        "The Tower of the Elephant\n",
        "50\n",
        "'Aye. By day they are kept in subterranean caverns below the tower. That's why there are no guards in\n",
        "this garden.' Conan counted the eyes rapidly.\n",
        "'Five in sight; maybe more back in the bushes. They'll charge in a moment--'\n",
        "'Be silent!' hissed Taurus, and he moved out from the wall, cautiously as if treading on razors, lifting the\n",
        "slender tube. Low rumblings rose from the shadows and the blazing eyes moved forward. Conan could\n",
        "sense the great slavering jaws, the tufted tails lashing tawny sides. The air grew tense--the Cimmerian\n",
        "gripped his sword, expecting the charge and the irresistible hurtling of giant bodies. Then Taurus\n",
        "brought the mouth of the tube to his lips and blew powerfully. A long jet of yellowish powder shot from\n",
        "the other end of the tube and billowed out instandy in a thick green-yellow cloud that settled over the\n",
        "shrubbery, blotting out the glaring eyes.\n",
        "Taurus ran back hastily to the wall. Conan glared without understanding. The thick cloud hid the\n",
        "shrubbery, and from it no sound came.\n",
        "'What is that mist?' the Cimmerian asked uneasily.\n",
        "'Death!' hissed the Nemedian. 'If a wind springs up and blows it back upon us, we must flee over the wall.\n",
        "But no, the wind is still, and now it is dissipating. Wait until it vanishes entirely. To breathe it is death.'\n",
        "Presently only yellowish shreds hung ghostily in the air; then they were gone, and Taurus motioned his\n",
        "companion forward. They stole toward the bushes, and Conan gasped. Stretched out in the shadows lay\n",
        "five great tawny shapes, the fire of their grim eyes dimmed for ever. A sweetish cloying scent lingered in\n",
        "the atmosphere.\n",
        "'They died widiout a sound!' muttered the Cimmerian. 'Taurus, what was that powder?'\n",
        "'It was made from the black lotus, whose blossoms wave in the lost jungles of Khitai, where only the\n",
        "yellow-skulled priests of Yun dwell. Those blossoms strike dead any who smell of them.'\n",
        "Conan knelt beside the great forms, assuring himself that they were indeed beyond power of harm. He\n",
        "shook his head; the magic of the exotic lands was mysterious and terrible to the barbarians of the north.\n",
        "'Why can you not slay the soldiers in the tower in the same way?' he asked.\n",
        "'Because that was all the powder I possessed. The obtaining of it was a feat which in itself was enough to\n",
        "make me famous among the thieves of the world. I stole it out of a caravan bound for Stygia, and I lifted\n",
        "it, in its cloth-of-gold bag, out of the coils of the great serpent which guarded it, without awaking him.\n",
        "But come, in Bel's name! Are we to waste the night in discussion?'\n",
        "They glided through the shrubbery to the gleaming foot of the tower, and there, with a motion enjoining\n",
        "silence, Taurus unwound his knotted cord, on one end of which was a strong steel hook. Conan saw his\n",
        "plan, and asked no questions as the Nemedian gripped the line a short distance below the hook, and\n",
        "began to swing it about his head. Conan laid his ear to the smooth wall and listened, but could hear\n",
        "nothing. Evidendy the soldiers within did not suspect the presence of intruders, who had made no more\n",
        "sound than the night wind blowing through the trees. But a strange nervousness was on the barbarian;\n",
        "perhaps it was the lion-smell which was over everything.\n",
        "The Tower of the Elephant\n",
        "51\n",
        "Taurus threw the line with a smooth, ripping motion of his mighty arm. The hook curved upward and\n",
        "inward in a peculiar manner, hard to describe, and vanished over the jeweled rim. It apparently caught\n",
        "firmly, for cautious jerking and then hard pulling did not result in any slipping or giving.\n",
        "'Luck the first cast,' murmured Taurus. 'I--'\n",
        "It was Conan's savage instinct which made him wheel suddenly; for the death that was upon them made\n",
        "no sound. A fleeting glimpse showed the Cimmerian the giant tawny shape, rearing upright against the\n",
        "stars, towering over him for the death-stroke. No civilized man could have moved half so quickly as the\n",
        "barbarian moved. His sword flashed frostily in the starlight with every ounce of desperate nerve and\n",
        "thew behind it, and man and beast went down together.\n",
        "Cursing incoherently beneath his breath, Taurus bent above the mass, and saw his companion's limbs\n",
        "move as he strove to drag himself from under the great weight that lay limply upon him. A glance\n",
        "showed the startled Nemedian that the lion was dead, its slanting skull split in half. He laid hold of the\n",
        "carcass, and by his aid, Conan thrust it aside and clambered up, still gripping his dripping sword.\n",
        "'Are you hurt, man?' gasped Taurus, still bewildered by the stunning swiftness of that touch-and-go\n",
        "episode.\n",
        "'No, by Crom!' answered the barbarian. 'But that was as close a call as I've had in a life noways tame. Why\n",
        "did not the cursed beast roar as he charged?'\n",
        "'All things are strange in this garden,' said Taurus. 'The lions strike silently--and so do other deaths. But\n",
        "come--little sound was made in that slaying, but the soldiers might have heard, if they are not asleep or\n",
        "drunk. That beast was in some other part of the garden and escaped the death of the flowers, but surely\n",
        "there are no more. We must climb this cord--little need to ask a Cimmerian if he can.'\n",
        "'If it will bear my weight,' grunted Conan, cleansing his sword on the grass.\n",
        "'It will bear thrice my own,' answered Taurus. 'It was woven from the tresses of dead women, which I\n",
        "took from their tombs at midnight, and steeped in the deadly wine of the upas tree, to give it strength. I\n",
        "will go first--then follow me closely.'\n",
        "The Nemedian gripped the rope and, crooking a knee about it, began the ascent; he went up like a cat,\n",
        "belying the apparent clumsiness of his bulk. The Cimmerian followed. The cord swayed and turned on\n",
        "itself, but the climbers were not hindered; both had made more difficult climbs before. The jeweled rim\n",
        "glittered high above them, jutting out from the perpendicular--a fact which added greatly to the ease of\n",
        "the ascent.\n",
        "Up and up they went, silently, the lights of the city spreading out further and further to their sight as they\n",
        "climbed, the stars above them more and more dimmed by the glitter of the jewels along the rim. Now\n",
        "Taurus reached up a hand and gripped the rim itself, pulling himself up and over. Conan paused a\n",
        "moment on the very edge, fascinated by the great frosty jewels whose gleams dazzled his eyes--diamonds,\n",
        "rubies, emeralds, sapphires, turquoises, moonstones, set thick as stars in the shimmering silver. At a\n",
        "distance their different gleams had seemed to merge into a pulsing white glare; but now, at close range,\n",
        "they shimmered with a million rainbow tints and lights, hypnotizing him with their scintillations.\n",
        "The Tower of the Elephant\n",
        "52\n",
        "'There is a fabulous fortune here, Taurus,' he whispered; but the Nemedian answered impatiently. 'Come\n",
        "on! If we secure the Heart, these and all other things shall be ours.'\n",
        "Conan climbed over the sparkling rim. The level of the tower's top was some feet below the gemmed\n",
        "ledge. It was flat, composed of some dark blue substance, set with gold that caught the starlight, so that\n",
        "the whole looked like a wide sapphire flecked with shining gold-dust. Across from the point where they\n",
        "had entered there seemed to be a sort of chamber, built upon the roof. It was of the same silvery material\n",
        "as the walls of the tower, adorned with designs worked in smaller gems; its single door was of gold, its\n",
        "surface cut in scales, and crusted with jewels that gleamed like ice.\n",
        "Conan cast a glance at the pulsing ocean of lights which spread far below them, then glanced at Taurus.\n",
        "The Nemedian was drawing up his cord and coiling it. He showed Conan where the hook had caught--a\n",
        "fraction of an inch of the point had sunk under a great blazing jewel on the inner side of the rim.\n",
        "'Luck was with us again,' he muttered. 'One would think that our combined weight would have torn that\n",
        "stone out. Follow me; the real risks of the venture begin now. We are in the serpent's lair, and we know\n",
        "not where he lies hidden.'\n",
        "Like stalking tigers they crept across the darkly gleaming floor and halted outside the sparkling door.\n",
        "With a deft and cautious hand Taurus tried it. It gave without resistance, and the companions looked in,\n",
        "tensed for anything. Over the Nemedian's shoulder Conan had a glimpse of a glittering chamber, the\n",
        "walls, ceiling and floor of which were crusted with great white jewels which lighted it brightly, and\n",
        "which seemed its only illumination. It seemed empty of life.\n",
        "'Before we cut off our last retreat,' hissed Taurus, 'go you to the rim and look over on all sides; if you see\n",
        "any soldiers moving in the gardens, or anything suspicious, return and tell me. I will await you within\n",
        "this chamber.'\n",
        "Conan saw scant reason in this, and a faint suspicion of his companion touched his wary soul, but he did\n",
        "as Taurus requested. As he turned away, the Nemedian slipt inside the door and drew it shut behind him.\n",
        "Conan crept about the rim of the tower, returning to his starting-point without having seen any\n",
        "suspicious movement in the vaguely waving sea of leaves below. He turned toward the door--suddenly\n",
        "from within the chamber there sounded a strangled cry.\n",
        "The Cimmerian leaped forward, electrified--the gleaming door swung open and Taurus stood framed in\n",
        "the cold blaze behind him. He swayed and his lips parted, but only a dry rattle burst from his throat.\n",
        "Catching at the golden door for support, he lurched out upon the roof, then fell headlong, clutching at his\n",
        "throat. The door swung to behind him.\n",
        "Conan, crouching like a panther at bay, saw nothing in the room behind the stricken Nemedian, in the\n",
        "brief instant the door was partly open--unless it was not a trick of the light which made it seem as if a\n",
        "shadow darted across the gleaming door. Nothing followed Taurus out on the roof, and Conan bent\n",

        "Gingerly the barbarian ran his hands over the man's half-naked body, seeking a wound. But the only\n",
        "marks of violence were between his shoulders, high up near the base of his bull-neck--three small\n",
        "wounds, which looked as if three nails had been driven deep in the flesh and withdrawn. The edges of\n",
        "these wounds were black, and a faint smell as of putrefaction was evident. Poisoned darts? thought\n",
        "Conan--but in that case the missiles should be still in the wounds.\n",
        "Cautiously he stole toward the golden door, pushed it open, and looked inside. The chamber lay empty,\n",
        "bathed in the cold, pulsing glow of the myriad jewels. In the very center of the ceiling he idly noted a\n",
        "curious design--a black eight-sided pattern, in the center of which four gems glittered with a red flame\n",
        "unlike the white blaze of the other jewels. Across the room there was another door, like the one in which\n",
        "he stood, except that it was not carved in the scale pattern. Was it from that door that death had come?--\n",
        "and having struck down its victim, had it retreated by the same way?\n",
        "Closing the door behind him, the Cimmerian advanced into the chamber. His bare feet made no sound on\n",

        "embroidered with gold and worked in strange serpentine designs, and several silver-bound mahogany\n",
        "chests. Some were sealed with heavy golden locks; others lay open, their carven lids thrown back,\n",
        "revealing heaps of jewels in a careless riot of splendor to the Cimmerian's astounded eyes. Conan swore\n",
        "beneath his breath; already he had looked upon more wealth that night than he had ever dreamed existed\n",
        "in allthe world, and he grew dizzy thinking of what must be the value of the jewel he sought.\n",
        "He was in the center of the room now, going stooped forward, head thrust out warily, sword advanced,\n",
        "when again death struck at him soundlessly. A flying shadow that swept across the gleaming floor was\n",
        "his only warning, and his instinctive sidelong leap all that saved his life. He had a flashing glimpse of a\n",
        "hairy black horror that swung past him with a clashing of frothing fangs, and something splashed on his\n",
        "bare shoulder that burned like drops of liquid hellfire. Springing back, sword high, he saw the horror\n",
        "strike the floor, wheel and scuttle toward him with appalling speed--a gigantic black spider, such as men\n",
        "see only in nightmare dreams.\n",
        "It was as large as a pig, and its eight thick hairy legs drove its ogreish body over the floor at headlong\n",

        "Conan knew, from the burning of his shoulder where only a few drops had splashed as the thing struck\n",
        "and missed, was laden with swift death. This was the killer that had dropped from its perch in the middle\n",
        "of the ceiling on a strand of its web, on the neck of the Nemedian. Fools that they were not to have\n",

        "These thoughts flashed briefly through Conan's mind as the monster rushed. He leaped high, and it\n",
        "passed beneath him, wheeled and charged back. This time he evaded its rush with a sidewise leap, and\n",

        "sinking its fangs into his back.\n",
        "Then began a desperate game, the wits and quickness of the man matched against the fiendish craft and\n",
        "speed of the giant spider. It no longer scuttled across the floor in a direct charge, or swung its body\n",
        "through the air at him. It raced about the ceiling and the walls, seeking to snare him in the long loops of\n",
        "sticky gray web-strands, which it flung with a devilish accuracy. These strands were thick as ropes, and\n",
        "Conan knew that once they were coiled about him, his desperate strength would not be enough to tear\n",

        "strands lay in coils on the floor; they were looped along the walls; they overlaid the jewel-chests and\n",
        "silken couches, and hung in dusky festoons from the jeweled ceiling. Conan's steel-trap quickness of eye\n",
        "and muscle had kept him untouched, though the sticky loops had passed him so close they rasped his\n",
        "naked hide. He knew he could not always avoid them; he not only had to watch the strands swinging\n",
        "from the ceiling, but to keep his eye on the floor, lest he trip in the coils that lay there. Sooner or later a\n",

        "clearing a couch--with a quick wheel the fiend ran up the wall, and the strand, leaping off the floor like a\n",
        "live thing, whipped about the Cimmerian's ankle. He caught himself on his hands as he fell, jerking\n",
        "frantically at the web which held him like a pliant vise, or the coil of a python. The hairy devil was racing\n",
        "down the wall to complete its capture. Stung to frenzy, Conan caught up a jewel chest and hurled it with\n",
        "all his strength. It was a move toe monster was not expecting. Full in the midst of the branching black legs\n",
        "the massive missile struck, smashing against the wall with a muffled sickening crunch. Blood and\n",
        "greenish slime spattered, and the shattered mass fell with the burst gem-chest to the floor. The crushed\n",

        "he picked his way among the gray coils and loops to the inner door. What horrors lay within he did not\n",
        "know. The Cimmerian's blood was up, and since he had come so far, and overcome so much peril, he was\n",
        "determined to go through to the grim finish of the adventure, whatever that might be. And he felt that the\n",
        "jewel he sought was not among the many so carelessly strewn about the gleaming chamber.\n",
        "Stripping off the loops that fouled the inner door, he found that it, like the other, was not locked. He\n",
        "wondered if the soldiers below were still unaware of his presence. Well, he was high above their heads,\n",
        "and if tales were to be believed, they were used to strange noises in the tower above them--sinister\n",
        "sounds, and screams of agony and horror.\n",
        "The Tower of the Elephant\n",
        "55\n",
        "Yara was on his mind, and he was not altogether comfortable as he opened the golden door. But he saw\n",
        "only a flight of silver steps leading down, dimly lighted by what means he could not ascertain. Down\n",
        "these he went silently, gripping his sword. He heard no sound, and came presently to an ivory door, set\n",
        "with blood-stones. He listened, but no sound came from within; only thin wisps of smoke drifted lazily\n",
        "from beneath the door, bearing a curious exotic odor unfamiliar to the Cimmerian. Below him the silver\n",
        "stair wound down to vanish in the dimness, and up that shadowy well no sound floated; he had an eery\n",
        "feeling that he was alone in a tower occupied only by ghosts and phantoms.\n",
        "Cautiously he pressed against the ivory door and it swung silently inward. On the shimmering threshold\n",
        "Conan stared like a wolf in strange surroundings, ready to fight or flee on the instant. He was looking\n",
        "into a large chamber with a domed golden ceiling; the walls were of green jade, the floor of ivory, partly\n",
        "covered by thick rugs. Smoke and exotic scent of incense floated up from a brazier on a golden tripod,\n",
        "and behind it sat an idol on a sort of marble couch. Conan stared aghast; the image had the body of a man,\n",
        "naked, and green in color; but the head was one of nightmare and madness. Too large for the human\n",
        "body, it had no attributes of humanity. Conan stared at the wide flaring ears, the curling proboscis, on\n",
        "either side of which stood white tusks tipped with round golden balls. The eyes were closed, as if in sleep.\n",
        "This then, was the reason for the name, the Tower of the Elephant, for the head of the thing was much\n",
        "like that of the beasts described by the Shemitish wanderer. This was Yara's god; where then should the\n",
        "gem be, but concealed in the idol, since the stone was called the Elephant's Heart?\n",
        "As Conan came forward, his eyes fixed on the motionless idol, the eyes of the thing opened suddenly!\n",
        "The Cimmerian froze in his tracks. It was no image--it was a living thing, and he was trapped in its\n",
        "chamber!\n",
        "That he did not instantly explode in a burst of murderous frenzy is a fact that measures his horror, which\n",
        "paralyzed him where he stood. A civilized man in his position would have sought doubtful refuge in the\n",
        "conclusion that he was insane; it did not occur to the Cimmerian to doubt his senses. He knew he was\n",
        "face to face with a demon of the Elder World, and the realization robbed him of all his faculties except\n",
        "sight.\n",
        "The trunk of the horror was lifted and quested about, the topaz eyes stared unseeingly, and Conan knew\n",
        "the monster was blind. With the thought came a thawing of his frozen nerves, and he began to back\n",
        "silently toward the door. But the creature heard. The sensitive trunk stretched toward him, and Conan's\n",
        "horror froze him again when the being spoke, in a strange, stammering voice that never changed its key\n",
        "or timbre. The Cimmerian knew that those jaws were never built or intended for human speech.\n",
        "'Who is here? Have you come to torture me again, Yara? Will you never be done? Oh, Yag-kosha, is there\n",
        "no end to agony?'\n",
        "Tears rolled from the sightless eyes, and Conan's gaze strayed to the limbs stretched on the marble couch.\n",
        "And he knew the monster would not rise to attack him. He knew the marks of the rack, and the searing\n",
        "brand of the flame, and tough-souled as he was, he stood aghast at the ruined deformities which his\n",
        "reason told him had once been limbs as comely as his own. And suddenly all fear and repulsion went\n",
        "from him, to be replaced by a great pity. What this monster was, Conan could not know, but the\n",
        "evidences of its sufferings were so terrible and pathetic that a strange aching sadness came over the \n",
        "The Tower of the Elephant\n",
        "56\n",
        "Cimmerian, he knew not why. He only felt that he was looking upon a cosmic tragedy, and he shrank\n",
        "with shame, as if the guilt of a whole race were laid upon him.\n",
        "'I am not Yara,' he said. 'I am only a thief. I will not harm you.'\n",
        "'Come near that I may touch you,' the creature faltered, and Conan came near unfearingly, his sword\n",
        "hanging forgotten in his hand. The sensitive trunk came out and groped over his face and shoulders, as a\n",
        "blind man gropes, and its touch was light as a girl's hand.\n",
        "'You are not of Yara's race of devils,' sighed the creature. 'The clean, lean fierceness of the wastelands\n",
        "marks you. I know your people from of old, whom I knew by another name in the long, long ago when\n",

        "know.'\n",
        "'Aye,' muttered Conan. 'The prince of all thieves lies there dead from the bite of a vermin.'\n",
        "'So--and so!' The strange inhuman voice rose in a sort of low chant. 'A slaying in the tavern and a slaying\n",
        "on the road--I know; I feel. And the third will make the magic of which not even Yara dreams--oh, magic\n",
        "of deliverance, green gods of Yag!'\n",
        "Again tears fell as the tortured body was rocked to and fro in the grip of varied emotions. Conan looked\n",

        "Then the convulsions ceased; the soft, sightless eyes were turned toward the Cimmerian, the trunk\n",
        "beckoned.\n",
        "'Oh man, listen,' said the strange being. 'I am foul and monstrous to you, am I not? Nay, do not answer; I\n",
        "know. But you would seem as strange to me, could I see you. There are many worlds besides this earth,\n",
        "and life takes many shapes. I am neither god nor demon, but flesh and blood like yourself, though the\n",

        "Kneeling before the portal, he searched the sill with nimble fingers; their sensitive tips found projections\n",
        "too small for the eye to detect, or for less-skilled fingers to discover. These he pressed carefully and\n",

        "There was no rasp of spring or hinge, but the door retreated inward, and the breath hissed explosively\n",
        "from Shevatas's clenched teeth. A short narrow corridor was disclosed. Down this the door had slid, and\n",
        "was now in place at the other end. The floor, ceiling and sides of the tunnel-like aperture were of ivory,\n",
        "and now from an opening on one side came a silent writhing horror that reared up and glared on the\n",

        "Shevatas advanced warily on the balls of his feet, knees bent slightly, ready to spring either way like a\n",
        "flash of light. And he needed all his co-ordinate speed when the snake arched its neck and struck,\n",
        "shooting out its full length like a stroke of lightning. For all his quickness of nerve and eye, Shevatas had\n",
        "died then but for chance. His well-laid plans of leaping aside and striking down on the outstretched neck\n",
        "were put at naught by the blinding speed of the reptile's attack. The thief had but time to extend the\n",
        "sword in front of him, involuntarily closing his eyes and crying out. Then the sword was wrenched from\n",
        "his hand and the corridor was filled with a horrible thrashing and lashing.\n",
        "Opening his eyes, amazed to find himself still alive, Shevatas saw the monster heaving and twisting its\n",
        "slimy form in fantastic contortions, the sword transfixing its giant jaws. Sheer chance had hurled it full\n",
        "against the point he had held out blindly. A few moments later the serpent sank into shining, scarcely\n",
        "quivering coils, as the poison on the blade struck home.\n",
        "Gingerly stepping over it, the thief thrust against the door, which this time slid aside, revealing the\n",
        "interior of the dome. Shevatas cried out; instead of utter darkness he had come into a crimson light that\n",
        "throbbed and pulsed almost beyond the endurance of mortal eyes. It came from a gigantic red jewel high\n",
        "up in the vaulted arch of the dome. Shevatas gaped, inured though he was to the sight of riches. The\n",
        "treasure was there, heaped in staggering profusion--piles of diamonds, sapphires, rubies, turquoises,\n",
        "opals, emeralds; zikkurats of jade, jet and lapis lazuli; pyramids of gold wedges; teocallis of silver ingots;\n",

        "Above her, in the darkest corner of the marble chamber, lurked a vast shapeless shadow. It was no living\n",
        "thing of form or flesh and blood. It was a clot of darkness, a blur in the sight, a monstrous night-born\n",

        "hissing of a serpent than anything else, and that apparently could not emanate from anything with\n",
        "human lips. Its sound as well as its import filled Yasmela with a shuddering horror so intolerable that she\n",

        "terrible. Ishtar was much to be feared, and all the gods of Koth. Kothian culture and religion had suffered\n",
        "from a subtle admixture of Shemite and Stygian strains. The simple ways of the Hyborians had become\n",

        "\"Will Mitra aid me?\" Yasmela caught Vateesa's wrist in her eagerness. \"We have worshipped Ishtar so\n",
        "long--\"\n",
        "\"To be sure he will!\" Vateesa was the daughter of an Ophirean priest who had brought his customs with\n",
        "him when he fled from political enemies to Khoraja. \"Seek the shrine! I will go with you.\"\n",
        "\"I will!\" Yasmela rose, but objected when Vateesa prepared to dress her. \"It is not fitting that I come\n",
        "before the shrine clad in silk. I will go naked, on my knees, as befits a suppliant, lest Mitra deem I lack\n",
        "humility.\"\n",
        "\"Nonsense!\" Vateesa had scant respect for the ways of what she deemed a false cult. \"Mitra would have\n",
        "folks stand upright before him--not crawling on their bellies like worms, or spilling blood of animals all\n",
        "over his altars.\"\n",
        "Thus objugated, Yasmela allowed the girl to garb her in the light sleeveless silk shirt, over which was\n",
        "slipped a silken tunic, bound at the waist by a wide velvet girdle. Satin slippers were put upon her\n",
        "slender feet, and a few deft touches of Vateesa's pink fingers arranged her dark wavy tresses. Then the\n",
        "princess followed the girl, who drew aside a heavy gilt-worked tapestry and threw the golden bolt of the\n",
        "door it concealed. This let into a narrow winding corridor, and down this the two girls went swiftly,\n",
        "through another door and into a broad hallway. Here stood a guardsman in crested gilt helmet, silvered\n",
        "cuirass and gold-chased greaves, with a long-shafted battleax in his hands.\n",
        "A motion from Yasmela checked his exclamation and, saluting, he took his stand again beside the\n",
        "doorway, motionless as a brazen image. The girls traversed the hallway, which seemed immense and\n",
        "eery in the light of the cressets along the lofty walls, and went down a stairway where Yasmela shivered \n",
        "Black Colossus\n",
        "66\n",
        "at the blots of shadows which hung in the angles of the walls. Three levels down they halted at last in a\n",
        "narrow corridor whose arched ceiling was crusted with jewels, whose floor was set with blocks of crystal,\n",
        "and whose walls were decorated with golden freizework. Down this shining way they stole, holding each\n",
        "other's hands, to a wide portal of gilt.\n",
        "Vateesa thrust open the door, revealing a shrine long forgotten except by a faithful few, and royal visitors\n",
        "to Khoraja's court, mainly for whose benefit the fane was maintained. Yasmela had never entered it\n",
        "before, though she was born in the palace. Plain and unadorned in comparison to the lavish display of\n",
        "Ishtar's shrines, there was about it a simplicity of dignity and beauty characteristic of the Mitran religion.\n",
        "The ceiling was lofty, but it was not domed, and was of plain white marble, as were the walls and floor,\n",
        "the former with a narrow gold frieze running about them. Behind an altar of clear green jade, unstained\n",
        "with sacrifice, stood the pedestal whereon sat the material manifestation of the deity. Yasmela looked in\n",
        "awe at the sweep of the magnificent shoulders, the clear-cut features--the wide straight eyes, the\n",
        "patriarchal beard, the thick curls of the hair, confined by a simple band about the temples. This, though\n",
        "she did not know it, was art in its highest form the free, uncramped artistic expression of a highly esthetic\n",
        "race, unhampered by conventional symbolism.\n",
        "She fell on her knees and thence prostrate, regardless of Vateesa's admonition, and Vateesa, to be on the\n",
        "safe side, followed her example; for after all, she was only a girl, and it was very awesome in Mitra's\n",
        "shrine. But even so she could not refrain from whispering in Yasmela's ear.\n",
        "\"This is but the emblem of the god. None pretends to know what Mitra looks like. This but represents him\n",
        "in idealized human form, as near perfection as the human mind can conceive. He does not inhabit this\n",
        "cold stone, as your priests tell you Ishtar does. He is everywhere--above us, and about us, and he dreams\n",
        "betimes in the high places among the stars. But here his being focusses. Therefore call upon him.\"\n",
        "\"What shall I say?\" whispered Yasmela in stammering terror.\n",
        "\"Before you can speak, Mitra knows the contents of your mind--\" began Vateesa. Then both girls started\n",
        "violently as a voice began in the air above them. The deep, calm, bell-like tones emanated no more from\n",
        "the image than from anywhere else in the chamber. Again Yasmela trembled before a bodiless voice\n",
        "speaking to her, but this time it was not from horror or repulsion.\n",
        "\"Speak not, my daughter, for I know your need,\" came the intonations like deep musical waves beating\n",
        "rhythmically along a golden beach. \"In one manner may you save your kingdom, and saving it, save all\n",
        "the world from the fangs of the serpent which has crawled up out of the darkness of the ages. Go forth\n",
        "upon the streets alone, and place your kingdom in the hands of the first man you meet there.\"\n",
        "The unechoing tones ceased, and the girls stared at each other. Then, rising, they stole forth, nor did they\n",
        "speak until they stood once more in Yasmela's chamber. The princess stared out of the gold-barred\n",
        "windows. The moon had set. It was long past midnight. Sounds of revelry had died away in the gardens\n",
        "and on the roofs of the city. Khoraja slumbered beneath the stars, which seemed to be reflected in the\n",
        "cressets that twinkled among the gardens and along the streets and on the flat roofs of houses where folk\n",
        "slept.\n",
        "\"What will you do?\" whispered Vateesa, all a-tremble.\n",
        "Black Colossus\n",
        "67\n",
        "\"Give me my cloak,\" answered Yasmela, setting her teeth.\n",
        "\"But alone, in the streets, at this hour!\" expostulated Vateesa.\n",
        "\"Mitra has spoken,\" replied the princess. \"It might have been the voice of the god, or a trick of a priest. No\n",
        "matter. I will go!\"\n",
        "Wrapping a voluminous silken cloak about her lithe figure and donning a velvet cap from which\n",
        "depended a filmy veil, she passed hurriedly through the corridors and approached a bronze door where\n",
        "a dozen spearmen gaped at her as she passed through. This was in a wing of the palace which let directly\n",
        "onto the street; on all other sides it was surrounded by broad gardens, bordered by a high wall. She\n",
        "emerged into the street, lighted by cressets placed at regular intervals.\n",
        "She hesitated; then, before her resolution could falter, she closed the door behind her. A slight shudder\n",
        "shook her as she glanced up and down the street, which lay silent and bare. This daughter of aristocrats\n",
        "had never before ventured unattended outside her ancestral palace. Then, steeling herself, she went\n",
        "swiftly up the street. Her satin-slippered feet fell lightly on the pave, but their soft sound brought her\n",
        "heart into her throat. She imagined their fall echoing thunderously through the cavernous city, rousing\n",
        "ragged rat-eyed figures in hidden lairs among the sewers. Every shadow seemed to hide a lurking\n",
        "assassin, every blank doorway to mask the slinking hounds of darkness.\n",
        "Then she started violently. Ahead of her a figure appeared on the eery street. She drew quickly into a\n",
        "clump of shadows, which now seemed like a haven of refuge, her pulse pounding. The approaching\n",
        "figure went not furtively, like a thief, or timidly, like a fearful traveller. He strode down the nighted street\n",
        "as one who has no need or desire to walk softly. An unconscious swagger was in his stride, and his\n",
        "footfalls resounded on the pave. As he passed near a cresset she saw him plainly--a tall man, in the chainmail hauberk of a mercenary. She braced herself, then darted from the shadow, holding her cloak close\n",
        "about her.\n",
        "\"Sa-ha!\" his sword flashed half out of his sheath. It halted when he saw it was only a woman that stood\n",
        "before him, but his quick glance went over her head, seeking the shadows for possible confederates.\n",
        "He stood facing her, his hand on the long hilt that jutted forward from beneath the scarlet cloak which\n",
        "flowed carelessly from his mailed shoulders. The torchlight glinted dully on the polished blue steel of his\n",
        "greaves and basinet. A more baleful fire glittered bluely in his eyes. At first glance she saw he was no\n",
        "Kothian; when he spoke she knew he was no Hyborian. He was clad like a captain of the mercenaries,\n",
        "and in that desperate command there were men of many lands, barbarians as well as civilized foreigners.\n",
        "There was a wolfishness about this warrior that marked the barbarian. The eyes of no civilized man,\n",
        "however wild or criminal, ever blazed with such a fire. Wine scented his breath, but he neither staggered\n",
        "nor stammered.\n",
        "\"Have they shut you into the street?\" he asked in barbarous Kothic, reaching for her. His fingers closed\n",
        "lightly about her rounded wrist, but she felt that he could splinter its bones without effort. \"I've but come\n",
        "from the last wine shop open Ishtar's curse on these white-livered reformers who close the grog-houses!\n",
        "'Let men sleep rather than guzzle,' they say--aye, so they can work and fight better for their masters! Softgutted eunuchs, I call them. When I served with the mercenaries of Corinthia we swilled and wenched all \n",
        "Black Colossus\n",
        "68\n",
        "night and fought all day; aye, blood ran down the channels of our swords. But what of you, my girl? Take\n",
        "off that cursed mask--\"\n",
        "She avoided his clutch with a lithe twist of her body, trying not to appear to repulse him. She realized her\n",
        "danger, alone with a drunken barbarian. If she revealed her identity, he might laugh at her, or take\n",
        "himself off. She was not sure he would not cut her throat. Barbaric men did strange inexplicable things.\n",
        "She fought a rising fear.\n",
        "\"Not here,\" she laughed. \"Come with me--\"\n",
        "\"Where?\" His wild blood was up, but he was wary as a wolf. \"Are you taking me to some den of robbers?\"\n",
        "\"No, no, I swear it!\" She was hard put to avoid the hand which was again fumbling at her veil.\n",
        "\"Devil bite you, hussy!\" he growled disgustedly. \"You're as bad as a Hyrkanian woman, with your\n",
        "damnable veil. Here--let me look at your figure, anyway.\"\n",
        "Before she could prevent it, he wrenched the cloak from her, and she heard his breath hiss between his\n",
        "teeth. He stood holding the cloak, eyeing her as if the sight of her rich garments had somewhat sobered\n",
        "him. She saw suspicion flicker sullenly in his eyes.\n",
        "\"Who the devil are you?\" he muttered. \"You're no street waif--unless your leman robbed the king's\n",
        "seraglio for your clothes.\"\n",
        "\"Never mind.\" She dared to lay her white hand on his massive iron-clad arm. \"Come with me off the\n",
        "street.\"\n",
        "He hesitated, then shrugged his mighty shoulders. She saw that he half believed her to be some noble\n",
        "lady, who, weary of polite lovers, was taking this means of amusing herself. He allowed her to don the\n",
        "cloak again, and followed her. From the corner of her eye she watched him as they went down the street\n",
        "together. His mail could not conceal his hard lines of tigerish strength. Everything about him was tigerish,\n",
        "elemental, untamed. He was alien as the jungle to her in his difference from the debonair courtiers to\n",
        "whom she was accustomed. She feared him, told herself she loathed his raw brute strength and\n",
        "unashamed barbarism, yet something breathless and perilous inside her leaned toward him; the hidden\n",
        "primitive chord that lurks in every woman's soul was sounded and responded. She had felt his hardened\n",
        "hand on her arm, and something deep in her tingled to the memory of that contact. Many men had knelt\n",
        "before Yasmela. Here was one she felt had never knelt before any one. Her sensations were those of one\n",
        "leading an unchained tiger; she was frightened, and fascinated by her fright.\n",
        "She halted at the palace door and thrust lightly against it. Furtively watching her companion, she saw no\n",
        "suspicion in his eyes.\n",
        "\"Palace, eh?\" he rumbled. \"So you're a maid-in-waiting?\"\n",
        "She found herself wondering, with a strange jealousy, if any of her maids had ever led this war-eagle into\n",
        "her palace. The guards made no sign as she led him between them, but he eyed them as a fierce dog\n",
        "might eye a strange pack. She led him through a curtained doorway into an inner chamber, where he\n",
        "stood, naively scanning the tapestries, until he saw a crystal jar of wine on an ebony table. This he took \n",
        "Black Colossus\n",
        "69\n",
        "up with a gratified sigh, tilting it toward his lips. Vateesa ran from an inner room, crying breathlessly,\n",
        "\"Oh my princess--\"\n",
        "\"Princess!\"\n",
        "The wine jar crashed to the floor. With a motion too quick for sight to follow, the mercenary snatched off\n",
        "Yasmela's veil, glaring. He recoiled with a curse, his sword leaping into his hand with a broad shimmer\n",
        "of blue steel. His eyes blazed like a trapped tiger's. The air was supercharged with tension that was like\n",
        "the pause before the bursting of a storm. Vateesa sank to the floor, speechless with terror, but Yasmela\n",
        "faced the infuriated barbarian without flinching. She realized her very life hung in the balance:\n",
        "maddened with suspicion and unreasoning panic, he was ready to deal death at the slightest provocation.\n",
        "But she experienced a certain breathless exhilaration in the crisis.\n",
        "\"Do not be afraid,\" she said. \"I am Yasmela, but there is no reason to fear me.\"\n",
        "\"Why did you lead me here?\" he snarled, his blazing eyes darting all about the chamber. \"What manner of\n",
        "trap is this?\"\n",
        "\"There is no trickery,\" she answered. \"I brought you here because you can aid me. I called on the gods--on\n",
        "Mitra--and he bade me go into the streets and ask aid of the first man I met.\"\n",
        "This was something he could understand. The barbarians had their oracles. He lowered his sword,\n",
        "though he did not sheathe it.\n",
        "\"Well, if you're Yasmela, you need aid,\" he grunted. \"Your kingdom's in a devil of a mess. But how can I\n",
        "aid you? If you want a throat cut, of course--\"\n",
        "\"Sit down,\" she requested. \"Vateesa, bring him wine.\"\n",
        "He complied, taking care, she noticed, to sit with his back against a solid wall, where he could watch the\n",
        "whole chamber. He laid his naked sword across his mail-sheathed knees. She glanced at it in fascination.\n",
        "Its dull blue glimmer seemed to reflect tales of bloodshed and rapine; she doubted her ability to lift it, yet\n",
        "she knew that the mercenary could wield it with one hand as lightly as she could wield a riding whip.\n",
        "She noted the breadth and power of his hands; they were not the stubby undeveloped paws of a\n",
        "troglodyte. With a guilty start she found herself imagining those strong fingers locked in her dark hair.\n",
        "He seemed reassured when she deposited herself on a satin divan opposite him. He lifted off his basinet\n",
        "and laid it on the table, and drew back his coif, letting the mail folds fall upon his massive shoulders. She\n",
        "saw more fully now his unlikeness to the Hyborian races. In his dark, scarred face there was a suggestion\n",
        "of moodiness; and without being marked by depravity, or definitely evil, there was more than a\n",
        "suggestion of the sinister about his features, set off by his smoldering blue eyes. A low broad forehead\n",
        "was topped by a square-cut tousled mane as black as a raven's wing.\n",
        "\"Who are you?\" she asked abruptly.\n",
        "\"Conan, a captain of the mercenary spearmen,\" he answered, emptying the wine cup at a gulp and\n",
        "holding it out for more. \"I was born in Cimmeria.\"\n",
        "Black Colossus\n",
        "70\n",
        "The name meant little to her. She only knew vaguely that it was a wild grim hill-country which lay far to\n",
        "the north, beyond the last outposts of the Hyborian nations, and was peopled by a fierce moody race. She\n",
        "had never before seen one of them.\n",
        "Resting her chin on her hands, she gazed at him with the deep dark eyes that had enslaved many a heart.\n",
        "\"Conan of Cimmeria,\" she said, \"you said I needed aid. Why?\"\n",
        "\"Well,\" he answered, \"any man can see that. Here is the king your brother in an Ophirean prison; here is\n",
        "Koth plotting to enslave you; here is this sorcerer screaming hell-fire and destruction down in Shem--and\n",
        "what's worse, here are your soldiers deserting every day.\"\n",
        "She did not at once reply; it was a new experience for a man to speak so forthrightly to her, his words not\n",
        "couched in courtier phrases.\n",
        "\"Why are my soldiers deserting, Conan?\" she asked.\n",
        "\"Some are being hired away by Koth,\" he replied, pulling at the wine jar with relish. \"Many think Khoraja\n",
        "is doomed as an independent state. Many are frightened by tales of this dog Natohk.\"\n",
        "\"Will the mercenaries stand?\" she asked anxiously.\n",
        "\"As long as you pay us well,\" he answered frankly. \"Your politics are nothing to us. You can trust Amalric,\n",
        "our general, but the rest of us are only common men who love loot. If you pay the ransom Ophir asks,\n",
        "men say you'll be unable to pay us. In that case we might go over to the king of Koth, though that cursed\n",
        "miser is no friend of mine. Or we might loot this city. In a civil war the plunder is always plentiful.\"\n",
        "\"Why would you not go over to Natohk?\" she inquired.\n",
        "\"What could he pay us?\" he snorted. \"With fat-bellied brass idols he looted from the Shemite cities? As\n",
        "long as you're fighting Natohk, you may trust us.\"\n",
        "\"Would your comrades follow you?\" she asked abruptly.\n",
        "\"What do you mean?\"\n",
        "\"I mean,\" she answered deliberately, \"that I am going to make you commander of the armies of Khoraja!\"\n",
        "He stopped short, the goblet at his lips, which curved in a broad grin. His eyes blazed with a new light.\n",
        "\"Commander? Crom! But what will your perfumed nobles say?\"\n",
        "\"They will obey me!\" She clasped her hands to summon a slave, who entered, bowing deeply. \"Have\n",
        "Count Thespides come to me at once, and the chancellor Taurus, lord Amalric, and the Agha Shupras.\n",
        "\"I place my trust in Mitra,\" she said, bending her gaze on Conan, who was now devouring the food\n",
        "placed before him by the trembling Vateesa. \"You have seen much war?\"\n",
        "Black Colossus\n",
        "71\n",
        "\"I was born in the midst of a battle,\" he answered, tearing a chunk of meat from a huge joint with his\n",
        "strong teeth. \"The first sound my ears heard was the clang of swords and the yells of the slaying. I have\n",
        "fought in blood feuds, tribal wars, and imperial campaigns.\"\n",
        "\"But can you lead men and arrange battle lines?\"\n",
        "\"Well, I can try,\" he returned imperturbably. \"It's no more than sword-play on a larger scale. You draw\n",
        "his guard, then stab, slash! And either his head is off, or yours.\"\n",
        "The slave entered again, announcing the arrival of the men sent for, and Yasmela went into the outer\n",
        "chamber, drawing the velvet curtains behind her. The nobles bent the knee, in evident surprize at her\n",
        "summons at such an hour.\n",
        "\"I have summoned you to tell you of my decision,\" said Yasmela. \"The kingdom is in peril--\"\n",
        "\"Right enough, my princess.\" It was Count Thespides who spoke--a tall man, whose black locks were\n",
        "curled and scented. With one white hand he smoothed his pointed mustache, and with the other he held\n",
        "a velvet chaperon with a scarlet feather fastened by a golden clasp. His pointed shoes were satin, his cotehardie of gold-broidered velvet. His manner was slightly affected, but the thews under his silks were\n",
        "steely. \"It were well to offer Ophir more gold for your royal brother's release.\"\n",
        "\"I strongly disagree,\" broke in Taurus the chancellor, an elderly man in an ermine-fringed robe, whose\n",
        "features were lined with the cares of his long service. \"We have already offered what will beggar the\n",
        "kingdom to pay. To offer more would further excite Ophir's cupidity. My princess, I say as I have said\n",
        "before: Ophir will not move until we have met this invading horde. If we lose, he will give king Khossus\n",
        "to Koth; if we win, he will doubtless restore his majesty to us on payment of the ransom.\"\n",
        "\"And in the meantime,\" broke in Amalric, \"the soldiers desert daily, and the mercenaries are restless to\n",
        "know why we dally.\" He was a Nemedian, a large man with a lion-like yellow mane. \"We must move\n",
        "swiftly, if at all--\"\n",
        "\"Tomorrow we march southward,\" she answered. \"And there is the man who shall lead you!\"\n",
        "Jerking aside the velvet curtains she dramatically indicated the Cimmerian. It was perhaps not an entirely\n",
        "happy moment for the disclosure. Conan was sprawled in his chair, his feet propped on the ebony table,\n",
        "busily engaged in gnawing a beef bone which he gripped firmly in both hands. He glanced casually at the\n",
        "astounded nobles, grinned faintly at Amalric, and went on munching with undisguised relish.\n",
        "\"Mitra protect us!\" exploded Amalric. \"That's Conan the northron, the most turbulent of all my rogues! I'd\n",
        "have hanged him long ago, were he not the best swordsman that ever donned hauberk--\"\n",
        "\"Your highness is pleased to jest!\" cried Thespides, his aristocratic features darkening. \"This man is a\n",
        "savage--a fellow of no culture or breeding! It is an insult to ask gentlemen to serve under him! I--\"\n",
        "\"Count Thespides,\" said Yasmela, \"you have my glove under your baldric. Please give it to me, and then\n",
        "go.\"\n",
        "\"Go?\" he cried, starting. \"Go where?\"\n",
        "Black Colossus\n",
        "72\n",
        "\"To Koth or to Hades!\" she answered. \"If you will not serve me as I wish, you shall not serve me at all.\"\n",
        "\"You wrong me, princess,\" he answered, bowing low, deeply hurt. \"I would not forsake you. For your\n",
        "sake I will even put my sword at the disposal of this savage.\"\n",
        "\"And you, my lord Amalric?\"\n",
        "Amalric swore beneath his breath, then grinned. True soldier of fortune, no shift of fortune, however\n",
        "outrageous, surprized him much.\n",
        "\"I'll serve under him. A short life and a merry one, say I--and with Conan the Throat-slitter in command,\n",

        "foot in chain-mail, they wore their vizorless head-pieces over linked coifs. Their shields were unadorned,\n",
        "their long lances without guidons. At their saddle-bows hung battleaxes or steel maces, and each man\n",
        "wore at his hip a long broadsword. The spearmen were armed in much the same manner, though they\n",

        "beside the gaming-tables; its bony fingers rattled the wine cups. It loomed above him, a hooded and\n",

        "For answer he drew off his scarlet cloak and wrapped it about her, roughly, as if tenderness of any kind\n",
        "were impossible to him. His iron hand rested for an instant on her slender shoulder, and she shivered\n",
        "again, but not with fear. Like an electric shock a surge of animal vitality swept over her at his mere touch,\n",

        "resting, but motionless for the instant, awaiting the signal to plunge again into terrific action. The firelight\n",
        "played on his features, making them seem as if carved out of substance shadowy yet hard as steel. They\n",

        "fear, though not because of anything she saw.\n",
        "It was a low mutter of voices that roused her. Opening her eyes, she saw that the fire was burning low. A\n",
        "feeling of dawn was in the air. She could dimly see that Conan still sat on the boulder; she glimpsed the\n",
        "long blue glimmer of his blade. Close beside him crouched another figure, on which the dying fire cast a\n",
        "faint glow. Yasmela drowsily made out a hooked beak of a nose, a glittering bead of an eye, under a\n",

        "of Altaku. So through the hills the soldiers pushed hastily, leaving the wagon trains to follow. Yasmela\n",
        "rode with them; her eyes were haunted. The nameless horror had been taking even more awful shape,\n",
        "since she had recognized the coin in the Shemite's hand the night before--one of those secretly molded by\n",

        "but one of which were closed on the northern extremity by rugged cliffs. This one was the Pass. It was\n",
        "much like a great hand extended from the hills; two fingers, parted, formed a fan-shaped valley. The\n",
        "fingers were represented by a broad ridge on either hand, the outer sides sheer, the inner, steep slopes.\n",
        "The vale pitched upward as it narrowed, to come out on a plateau, flanked by gully-torn slopes. A well\n",
        "was there, and a cluster of stone towers, occupied by the Zaheemis.\n",
        "There Conan halted, swinging off his horse. He had discarded the plate-armor for the more familiar\n",

        "\"Let them be,\" replied Conan. \"It goes hard for them to take orders from me. Tell the dog-brothers to ease\n",

        "No need to send out scouts. The desert lay bare to the gaze, though just now this view was limited by\n",
        "low-lying clouds which rested in whitish masses on the southern horizon. The monotony was broken\n",
        "only by a jutting tangle of stone ruins, some miles out on the desert, reputedly the remnants of an ancient\n",
        "Stygian temple. Conan dismounted the archers and ranged them along the ridges, with the wild\n",
        "tribesmen. He stationed the mercenaries and the Khoraji spearmen on the plateau about the well. Farther\n",
        "back, in the angle where the hill road debouched on the plateau, was pitched Yasmela's pavilion.\n",
        "With no enemy in sight, the warriors relaxed. Basinets were doffed, coifs thrown back on mailed\n",
        "shoulders, belts let out. Rude jests flew back and forth as the fighting-men gnawed beef and thrust their\n",
        "muzzles deep into ale-jugs. Along the slopes the hillmen made themselves at ease, nibbling dates and\n",
        "olives. Amalric strode up to where Conan sat bareheaded on a boulder.\n",
        "\"Conan, have you heard what the tribesmen say about Natohk? They say--Mitra, it's too mad even to\n",
        "repeat. What do you think?\"\n",
        "\"Seeds rest in the ground for centuries without rotting, sometimes,\" answered Conan. \"But surely Natohk\n",

        "\"I am not sure,\" grunted Amalric. \"At any rate, you've arranged your lines as well as a seasoned general\n",
        "could have done. It's certain Natohk's devils can't fall on us unawares. Mitra, what a fog!\"\n",
        "\"I thought it was clouds at first,\" answered Conan. \"See how it rolls!\"\n",
        "What had seemed clouds was a thick mist moving northward like a great unstable ocean, rapidly hiding\n",
        "the desert from view. Soon it engulfed the Stygian ruins, and still it rolled onward. The army watched in\n",
        "amazement. It was a thing unprecedented--unnatural and inexplicable.\n",
        "\"No use sending out scouts,\" said Amalric disgustedly. \"They couldn't see anything. Its edges are near the\n",
        "outer flanges of the ridges. Soon the whole Pass and these hills will be masked--\"\n",
        "Conan, who had been watching the rolling mist with growing nervousness, bent suddenly and laid his\n",
        "ear to the earth. He sprang up with frantic haste, swearing.\n",
        "\"Horses and chariots, thousands of them! The ground vibrates to their tread! Ho, there!\" His voice\n",
        "thundered out across the valley to electrify the lounging men. \"Burganets and pikes, you dogs! Stand to\n",
        "your ranks!\"\n",
        "At that, as the warriors scrambled into their lines, hastily donning head-pieces and thrusting arms\n",
        "through shield-straps, the mist rolled away, as something no longer useful. It did not slowly lift and fade\n",
        "like a natural fog; it simply vanished, like a blown-out flame. One moment the whole desert was hidden\n",
        "with the rolling fleecy billows, piled mountainously, stratum above stratum; the next, the sun shone from\n",
        "a cloudless sky on a naked desert--no longer empty, but thronged with the living pageantry of war. A\n",
        "great shout shook the hills.\n",
        "At first glance the amazed watchers seemed to be looking down upon a glittering sparkling sea of bronze\n",
        "and gold, where steel points twinkled like a myriad stars. With the lifting of the fog the invaders had\n",
        "halted as if frozen, in long serried lines, flaming in the sun.\n",
        "First was a long line of chariots, drawn by the great fierce horses of Stygia, with plumes on their heads--\n",
        "snorting and rearing as each naked driver leaned back, bracing his powerful legs, his dusky arms knotted\n",
        "with muscles. The fighting-men in the chariots were tall figures, their hawk-like faces set off by bronze\n",
        "helmets crested with a crescent supporting a golden ball. Heavy bows were in their hands. No common\n",
        "archers these, but nobles of the South, bred to war and the hunt, who were accustomed to bringing down\n",
        "lions with their arrows.\n",
        "Behind these came a motley array of wild men on half-wild horses--the warriors of Kush, the first of the\n",
        "great black kingdoms of the grasslands south of Stygia. They were shining ebony, supple and lithe, riding\n",
        "stark naked and without saddle or bridle.\n",
        "After these rolled a horde that seemed to encompass all the desert. Thousands on thousands of the warlike Sons of Shem: ranks of horsemen in scale-mail corselets and cylindrical helmets--the asshuri of Nippr,\n",
        "Shumir and Eruk and their sister cities; wild white-robed hordes--the nomad clans.\n",
        "Now the ranks began to mill and eddy. The chariots drew off to one side while the main host came\n",

        "\"The lifting of the mist has confused them! Now is the time to charge! The Kushites have no bows and\n",
        "they mask the whole advance. A charge of my knights will crush them back into the ranks of the Shemites,\n",
        "disrupting their formation. Follow me! We will win this battle with one stroke!\"\n",
        "Conan shook his head. \"Were we fighting a natural foe, I would agree. But this confusion is more feigned\n",
        "than real, as if to draw us into a charge. I fear a trap.\"\n",
        "\"Then you refuse to move?\" cried Thespides, his face dark with passion.\n",
        "\"Be reasonable,\" expostulated Conan. \"We have the advantage of position--\"\n",

        "Amalric shook his head. \"You should not have let him return, Conan. I--look there!\"\n",
        "Conan sprang up with a curse. Thespides had swept in beside his men. They could hear his impassioned\n",
        "voice faintly, but his gesture toward the approaching horde was significant enough. In another instant\n",
        "five hundred lances dipped and the steel-clad company was thundering down the valley.\n",
        "A young page came running from Yasmela's pavilion, crying to Conan in a shrill, eager voice. \"My lord,\n",

        "\"You grow sober with authority,\" quoth Amalric. \"Such madness as that was always your particular joy.\"\n",
        "\"Aye, when I had only my own life to consider,\" answered Conan. \"Now--what in hell--\"\n",
        "The horde had halted. From the extreme wing rushed a chariot, the naked charioteer lashing the steeds\n",
        "like a madman; the other occupant was a tall figure whose robe floated spectrally on the wind. He held in\n",
        "his arms a great vessel of gold and from it poured a thin stream that sparkled in the sunlight. Across the\n",
        "whole front of the desert horde the chariot swept, and behind its thundering wheels was left, like the\n",

        "hoofs of the horses struck it, it was as when steel strikes flint--but with more terrible result. A terrific\n",

        "Now the illusion of confusion vanished as the horde settled into orderly lines. The wild Kushites rushed\n",
        "into the shambles, spearing the wounded, bursting the helmets of the knights with stones and iron\n",
        "hammers. It was all over so quickly that the watchers on the slopes stood dazed; and again the horde\n",
        "moved forward, splitting to avoid the charred waste of corpses. From the hills went up a cry: \"We fight\n",

        "handful in comparison to the thronging desert horde.\n",
        "Conan stood among the spearmen. He knew the invaders would not try to drive a chariot charge up the\n",
        "Pass in the teeth of the archers, but he grunted with surprize to see the riders dismounting. These wild\n",
        "men had no supply trains. Canteens and pouches hung at their saddle-peaks. Now they drank the last of\n",
        "their water and threw the canteens away.\n",

        "81\n",
        "Conan gazed over the billowing waves of spears and wondered what new horror the sorcerer would\n",

        "the offensive against him invited disaster.\n",
        "But surely it was magic that drove the horde on in the teeth of death. Conan caught his breath at the\n",
        "havoc wrought in the onsweeping ranks. The edges of the wedge seemed to be melting away, and\n",
        "already the valley was strewn with dead men. Yet the survivors came on like madmen unaware of death.\n",
        "By the very numbers of their bows, they began to swamp the archers on the cliffs. Clouds of shafts sped\n",
        "upward, driving the hillmen to cover. Panic struck at their hearts at that unwavering advance, and they\n",
        "plied their bows madly, eyes glaring like trapped wolves.\n",
        "As the horde neared the narrower neck of the Pass, boulders thundered down, crushing men by the\n",
        "scores, but the charge did not waver. Conan's wolves braced themselves for the inevitable concussion. In\n",
        "their close formation and superior armor, they took little hurt from the arrows. It was the impact of the\n",
        "charge Conan feared, when the huge wedge should crash against his thin ranks. And he realized now\n",
        "there was no breaking of that onslaught. He gripped the shoulder of a Zaheemi who stood near.\n",
        "\"Is there any way by which mounted men can get down into the blind valley beyond that western ridge?\"\n",
        "\"Aye, a steep, perilous path, secret and eternally guarded. But--\"\n",

        "\"Amalric!\" he snapped. \"Follow this man! He'll lead you into yon outer valley. Ride down it, circle the\n",

        "doomed anyway; we'll do all the damage we can before we die! Haste!\"\n",
        "Amalric's mustache bristled in a fierce grin, and a few moments later his lancers were following the guide\n",
        "into a tangle of gorges leading off from the plateau. Conan ran back to the pikemen, sword in hand.\n",
        "He was not too soon. On either ridge Shupras's hillmen, mad with anticipation of defeat, rained down\n",
        "their shafts desperately. Men died like flies in the valley and along the slopes--and with a roar and an\n",

        "fanaticism and ancient feuds, the tribesmen rent and slew and died. Wild hair flying, the naked Kushites\n",

        "82\n",
        "It seemed to Conan that his sweat-blinded eyes looked down into a rising ocean of steel that seethed and\n",
        "eddied, filling the valley from ridge to ridge. The fight was at a bloody deadlock. The hillmen held the\n",
        "ridges, and the mercenaries, gripping their dipping pikes, bracing their feet in the bloody earth, held the\n",
        "Pass. Superior position and armor for a space balanced the advantage of overwhelming numbers. But it\n",

        "The hill steed reared wildly under the unfamiliar clash of the Kothic armor, and Conan's gusty laugh rose\n",
        "above the din as he led them to where the eastern ridge branched away from the plateau. Five hundred\n",

        "leaving a crushed-down carpet of dead.\n",
        "And then, as the horde writhed and coiled upon itself, Amalric's lancers, having cut through a cordon of\n",
        "horsemen encountered in the outer valley, swept around the extremity of the western ridge and smote\n",
        "the host in a steel-tipped wedge, splitting it asunder. His attack carried all the dazing demoralization of a\n",

        "Stunned by surprize, the horde broke before they had time to see it was but a handful which assailed\n",

        "remained in the saddle. But the horde was shattered. Nomads and mailed spearmen broke away, fleeing\n",

        "Reeling up, blood streaming down his face from under his dented helmet, Conan glared dizzily at the\n",

        "victors--and Conan stood appalled as he noted how few of these were left to pursue.\n",
        "Then an awful scream rent the clamor. Up the valley a chariot came flying, making nothing of the heaped\n",
        "corpses. No horses drew it, but a great black creature that was like a camel. In the chariot stood Natohk,\n",
        "his robes flying; and gripping the reins and lashing like mad, crouched a black anthropomorphic being\n",
        "that might have been a monster ape.\n",

        "where Yasmela stood alone, deserted by her guards in the frenzy of pursuit. Conan, standing frozen,\n",
        "heard her frenzied scream as Natohk's long arm swept her up into the chariot. Then the grisly steed\n",
        "wheeled and came racing back down the valley, and no man dared speed arrow or spear lest he strike\n",
        "Yasmela, who writhed in Natohk's arms.\n",
        "With an inhuman cry Conan caught up his fallen sword and leaped into the path of the hurtling horror.\n",

        "the girl from him. They rolled on the sand, and to Conan's dazed gaze, the chariot and its steed altered\n",
        "awfully. Great wings spread from a black horror that in no way resembled a camel, and it rushed upward\n",
        "into the sky, bearing in its wake a shape of blinding flame, in which a black man-like shape gibbered in\n",

        "Conan shook his head, blinking. The sun's glare half blinded him. He lifted a small canteen from his belt\n",
        "and shook it, scowling at the faint splashing within.\n",
        "The girl moved wearily, whimpering.\n",
        "\"Oh, Conan, we shall die here! I am so thirsty!\"\n",
        "The Cimmerian growled wordlessly, glaring truculently at the surrounding waste, with outthrust jaw,\n",
        "and blue eyes smoldering savagely from under his black tousled mane, as if the desert were a tangible\n",
        "enemy.\n",
        "He stooped and put the canteen to the girl's lips.\n",
        "\"Drink till I tell you to stop, Natala,\" he commanded.\n",
        "She drank with little panting gasps, and he did not check her. Only when the canteen was empty did she\n",
        "realize that he had deliberately allowed her to drink all their water supply, little enough that it was.\n",
        "Tears sprang to her eyes. \"Oh, Conan,\" she wailed, wringing her hands, \"why did you let me drink it all? I\n",
        "did not know--now there is none for you!\"\n",
        "\"Hush,\" he growled. \"Don't waste your strength in weeping.\"\n",
        "Straightening, he threw the canteen from him.\n",
        "\"Why did you do that?\" she whispered.\n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "87\n",
        "He did not reply, standing motionless and immobile, his fingers closing slowly about the hilt of his saber.\n",
        "He was not looking at the girl; his fierce eyes seemed to plumb the mysterious purple hazes of the\n",
        "distance.\n",
        "Endowed with all the barbarian's ferocious love of life and instinct to live, Conan the Cimmerian yet\n",
        "knew that he had reached the end of his trail. He had not come to the limits of his endurance, but he\n",
        "knew another day under the merciless sun in those waterless wastes would bring him down. As for the\n",
        "girl, she had suffered enough. Better a quick painless sword-stroke than the lingering agony that faced\n",
        "him. Her thirst was temporarily quenched; it was a false mercy to let her suffer until delirium and death\n",
        "brought relief. Slowly he slid the saber from its sheath.\n",
        "He halted suddenly, stiffening. Far out on the desert to the south, something glimmered through the heat\n",
        "waves.\n",
        "At first he thought it was a phantom, one of the mirages which had mocked and maddened him in that\n",
        "accursed desert. Shading his sun-dazzled eyes, he made out spires and minarets, and gleaming walls. He\n",
        "watched it grimly, waiting for it to fade and vanish. Natala had ceased to sob; she struggled to her knees\n",
        "and followed his gaze.\n",
        "\"Is it a city, Conan?\" she whispered, too fearful to hope. \"Or is it but a shadow?\"\n",
        "The Cimmerian did not reply for a space. He closed and opened his eyes several times; he looked away,\n",
        "then back. The city remained where he had first seen it.\n",
        "\"The devil knows,\" he grunted. \"It's worth a try, though.\"\n",
        "He thrust the saber back in its sheath. Stooping, he lifted Natala in his mighty arms as though she had\n",
        "been an infant. She resisted weakly.\n",
        "\"Don't waste your strength carrying me, Conan,\" she pleaded. \"I can walk.\"\n",
        "\"The ground gets rockier here,\" he answered. \"You would soon wear your sandals to shreds,\" glancing at\n",
        "her soft green footwear. \"Besides, if we are to reach that city at all, we must do it quickly, and I can make\n",
        "better time this way.\"\n",
        "The chance for life had lent fresh vigor and resilience to the Cimmerian's steely thews. He strode out\n",
        "across the sandy waste as if he had just begun the journey. A barbarian of barbarians, the vitality and\n",
        "endurance of the wild were his, granting him survival where civilized men would have perished.\n",
        "He and the girl were, so far as he knew, the sole survivors of Prince Almuric's army, that mad motley\n",
        "horde which, following the defeated rebel prince of Koth, swept through the Lands of Shem like a\n",
        "devastating sandstorm and drenched the outlands of Stygia with blood. With a Stygian host on its heels,\n",
        "it had cut its way through the black kingdom of Kush, only to be annihilated on the edge of the southern\n",
        "desert. Conan likened it in his mind to a great torrent, dwindling gradually as it rushed southward, to\n",
        "run dry at last in the sands of the naked desert. The bones of its members--mercenaries, outcasts, broken\n",
        "men, outlaws--lay strewn from the Kothic uplands to the dunes of the wilderness.\n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "88\n",
        "From that final slaughter, when the Stygians and the Kushites closed in on the trapped remnants, Conan\n",
        "had cut his way clear and fled on a camel with the girl. Behind them the land swarmed with enemies; the\n",
        "only way open to them was the desert to the south. Into those menacing depths they had plunged.\n",
        "The girl was Brythunian, whom Conan had found in the slave market of a stormed Shemite city, and\n",
        "appropriated. She had had nothing to say in the matter, but her new position was so far superior to the\n",
        "lot of any Hyborian woman in a Shemitish seraglio, that she accepted it thankfully. So she had shared in\n",
        "the adventures of Almuric's damned horde.\n",
        "For days they had fled into the desert, pursued so far by Stygian horsemen that when they shook off the\n",
        "pursuit, they dared not turn back. They pushed on, seeking water, until the camel died. Then they went\n",
        "on foot. For the past few days their suffering had been intense. Conan had shielded Natala all he could,\n",
        "and the rough life of the camp had given her more stamina and strength than the average woman\n",
        "possesses; but even so, she was not far from collapse.\n",
        "The sun beat fiercely on Conan's tangled black mane. Waves of dizziness and nausea rose in his brain, but\n",
        "he set his teeth and strode on unwaveringly. He was convinced that the city was a reality and not a\n",
        "mirage. What they would find there he had no idea. The inhabitants might be hostile. Nevertheless it was\n",
        "a fighting chance, and that was as much as he had ever asked.\n",
        "The sun was nigh to setting when they halted in front of the massive gate, grateful for the shade. Conan\n",
        "stood Natala on her feet, and stretched his aching arms. Above them the walls towered some thirty feet in\n",
        "height, composed of a smooth greenish substance that shone almost like glass. Conan scanned the\n",
        "parapets, expecting to be challenged, but saw no one. Impatiently he shouted, and banged on the gate\n",
        "with his saber hilt, but only the hollow echoes mocked him. Natala cringed close to him, frightened by\n",
        "the silence. Conan tried the portal, and stepped back, drawing his saber, as it swung silently inward.\n",
        "Natala stifled a cry.\n",
        "\"Oh, look, Conan!\"\n",
        "Just inside the gate lay a human body. Conan glared at it narrowly, then looked beyond it. He saw a wide\n",
        "open expanse, like a court, bordered by the arched doorways of houses composed of the same greenish\n",
        "material as the outer walls. These edifices were lofty and imposing, pinnacled with shining domes and\n",
        "minarets. There was no sign of life among them. In the center of the court rose the square curb of a well,\n",
        "and the sight stung Conan, whose mouth felt caked with dry dust. Taking Natala's wrist he drew her\n",
        "through the gate, and closed it behind them.\n",
        "\"Is he dead?\" she whispered, shrinkingly indicating the man who lay limply before the gate. The body\n",
        "was that of a tall powerful individual, apparently in his prime; the skin was yellow, the eyes slightly\n",
        "slanted; otherwise the man differed little from the Hyborian type. He was clad in high-strapped sandals\n",
        "and a tunic of purple silk, and a short sword in a cloth-of-gold scabbard hung from his girdle. Conan felt\n",
        "his flesh. It was cold. There was no sign of life in the body.\n",
        "\"Not a wound on him,\" grunted the Cimmerian, \"but he's dead as Almuric with forty Stygian arrows in\n",
        "him. In Crom's name, let's see to the well! If there's water in it, we'll drink, dead men or no.\"\n",
        "There was water in the well, but they did not drink of it. Its level was a good fifty feet below the curb, and\n",
        "there was nothing to draw it up with. Conan cursed blackly, maddened by the sight of the stuff just out of \n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "89\n",
        "his reach, and turned to look for some means of obtaining it. Then a scream from Natala brought him\n",
        "about.\n",
        "The supposedly dead man was rushing upon him, eyes blazing with indisputable life, his short sword\n",
        "gleaming in his hand. Conan cursed amazedly, but wasted no time in conjecture. He met the hurtling\n",
        "attacker with a slashing cut of his saber that sheared through flesh and bone. The fellow's head thudded\n",
        "on the flags; the body staggered drunkenly, an arch of blood jetting from the severed jugular; then it fell\n",
        "heavily.\n",
        "Conan glared down, swearing softly.\n",
        "\"This fellow is no deader now than he was a few minutes agone. Into what madhouse have we strayed?\"\n",
        "Natala, who had covered her eyes with her hands at the sight, peeked between her fingers and shook\n",
        "with fear.\n",
        "\"Oh, Conan, will the people of the city not kill us, because of this?\"\n",
        "\"Well,\" he growled, \"this creature would have killed us if I hadn't lopped off his head.\"\n",
        "He glanced at the archways that gaped blankly from the green walls above them. He saw no hint of\n",
        "movement, heard no sound.\n",
        "\"I don't think any one saw us,\" he muttered. \"I'll hide the evidence--\"\n",
        "He lifted the limp carcass by its sword belt with one hand, and grasping the head by its long hair in the\n",
        "other, he half carried, half dragged the ghastly remains over to the well.\n",
        "\"Since we can't drink this water,\" he gritted vindictively, \"I'll see that nobody else enjoys drinking it.\n",
        "Curse such a well, anyway!\" He heaved the body over the curb and let it drop, tossing the head after it. A\n",
        "dull splash sounded far beneath.\n",
        "\"There's blood on the stones,\" whispered Natala.\n",
        "\"There'll be more unless I find water soon,\" growled the Cimmerian, his short store of patience about\n",
        "exhausted. The girl had almost forgotten her thirst and hunger in her fear, but not Conan.\n",
        "\"We'll go into one of these doors,\" he said. \"Surely we'll find people after awhile.\"\n",
        "\"Oh, Conan!\" she wailed, snuggling up as close to him as she could. \"I'm afraid! This is a city of ghosts\n",
        "and dead men! Let us go back into the desert! Better to die there, than to face these terrors!\"\n",
        "\"We'll go into the desert when they throw us off the walls,\" he snarled. \"There's water somewhere in this\n",
        "city, and I'll find it, if I have to kill every man in it.\"\n",
        "\"But what if they come to life again?\" she whispered.\n",
        "\"Then I'll keep killing them until they stay dead!\" he snapped. \"Come on! That doorway is as good as\n",
        "another! Stay behind me, but don't run unless I tell you to.\"\n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "90\n",
        "She murmured a faint assent and followed him so closely that she stepped on his heels, to his irritation.\n",
        "Dusk had fallen, filling the strange city with purple shadows. They entered the open doorway, and found\n",
        "themselves in a wide chamber, the walls of which were hung with velvet tapestries, worked in curious\n",
        "designs. Floor, walls and ceiling were of the green glassy stone, the walls decorated with gold frieze-work.\n",
        "Furs and satin cushions littered the floor. Several doorways let into other rooms. They passed through,\n",
        "and traversed several chambers, counterparts of the first. They saw no one, but the Cimmerian grunted\n",
        "suspiciously.\n",
        "\"Some one was here not long ago. This couch is still warm from contact with a human body. That silk\n",
        "cushion bears the imprint of some one's hips. Then there's a faint scent of perfume lingering in the air.\"\n",
        "A weird unreal atmosphere hung over all. Traversing this dim silent palace was like an opium dream.\n",
        "Some of the chambers were unlighted, and these they avoided. Others were bathed in a soft weird light\n",
        "that seemed to emanate from jewels set in the walls in fantastic designs. Suddenly, as they passed into\n",
        "one of these illumined chambers, Natala cried out and clutched her companion's arm. With a curse he\n",
        "wheeled, glaring for an enemy, bewildered because he saw none.\n",
        "\"What's the matter?\" he snarled. \"If you ever grab my sword arm again, I'll skin you. Do you want me to\n",
        "get my throat cut? What were you yelling about?\"\n",
        "\"Look there,\" she quavered, pointing.\n",
        "Conan grunted. On a table of polished ebony stood golden vessels, apparently containing food and drink.\n",
        "The room was unoccupied.\n",
        "\"Well, whoever this feast is prepared for,\" he growled, \"he'll have to look elsewhere tonight.\"\n",
        "\"Dare we eat it, Conan?\" ventured the girl nervously. \"The people might come upon us, and--\"\n",
        "\"Lir an mannanan mac lira,\" he swore, grabbing her by the nape of her neck and thrusting her into a\n",
        "gilded chair at the end of the table with no great ceremony. \"We starve and you make objections! Eat!\"\n",
        "He took the chair at the other end, and seizing a jade goblet, emptied it at a gulp. It contained a crimson\n",
        "wine-like liquor of a peculiar tang, unfamiliar to him, but it was like nectar to his parched gullet. His\n",
        "thirst allayed, he attacked the food before him with rare gusto. It too was strange to him: exotic fruits and\n",
        "unknown meats. The vessels were of exquisite workmanship, and there were golden knives and forks as\n",
        "well. These Conan ignored, grasping the meat joints in his fingers and tearing them with his strong teeth.\n",
        "The Cimmerian's table manners were rather wolfish at any time. His civilized companion ate more\n",
        "daintily, but just as ravenously. It occurred to Conan that the food might be poisoned, but the thought\n",
        "did not lessen his appetite; he preferred to die of poisoning rather than starvation.\n",
        "His hunger satisfied, he leaned back with a deep sigh of relief. That there were humans in that silent city\n",
        "was evidenced by the fresh food, and perhaps every dark corner concealed a lurking enemy. But he felt\n",
        "no apprehension on that score, having a large confidence in his own fighting ability. He began to feel\n",
        "sleepy, and considered the idea of stretching himself on a near-by couch for a nap.\n",
        "Not so Natala. She was no longer hungry and thirsty, but she felt no desire to sleep. Her lovely eyes were\n",
        "very wide indeed as she timidly glanced at the doorways, boundaries of the unknown. The silence and \n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "91\n",
        "mystery of the strange place preyed on her. The chamber seemed larger, the table longer than she had\n",
        "first noticed, and she realized that she was farther from her grim protector than she wished to be. Rising\n",
        "quickly, she went around the table and seated herself on his knee, glancing nervously at the arched\n",
        "doorways. Some were lighted and some were not, and it was at the unlighted ones she gazed longest.\n",
        "\"We have eaten, drunk and rested,\" she urged. \"Let us leave this place, Conan. It's evil. I can feel it.\"\n",
        "\"Well, we haven't been harmed so far,\" he began, when a soft but sinister rustling brought him about.\n",
        "Thrusting the girl off his knee he rose with the quick ease of a panther, drawing his saber, facing the\n",
        "doorway from which the sound had seemed to come. It was not repeated, and he stole forward\n",
        "noiselessly, Natala following with her heart in her mouth. She knew he suspected peril. His outthrust\n",
        "head was sunk between his giant shoulders, he glided forward in a half crouch, like a stalking tiger. He\n",
        "made no more noise than a tiger would have made.\n",
        "At the doorway he halted, Natala peering fearfully from behind him. There was no light in the room, but\n",
        "it was partially illuminated by the radiance behind them, which streamed across it into yet another\n",
        "chamber. And in this chamber a man lay on a raised dais. The soft light bathed him, and they saw he was\n",
        "a counterpart of the man Conan had killed before the outer gate, except that his garments were richer,\n",
        "and ornamented with jewels which twinkled in the uncanny light. Was he dead, or merely sleeping?\n",
        "Again came that faint sinister sound, as if some one had thrust aside a hanging. Conan drew back,\n",
        "drawing the clinging Natala with him. He clapped his hand over her mouth just in time to check her\n",
        "shriek.\n",
        "From where they now stood, they could no longer see the dais, but they could see the shadow it cast on\n",
        "the wall behind it. And now another shadow moved across the wall: a huge shapeless black blot. Conan\n",
        "felt his hair prickle curiously as he watched. Distorted though it might be, he felt that he had never seen a\n",
        "man or beast which cast such a shadow. He was consumed with curiosity, but some instinct held him\n",
        "frozen in his tracks. He heard Natala's quick panting gasps as she stared with dilated eyes. No other\n",
        "sound disturbed the tense stillness. The great shadow engulfed that of the dais. For a long instant only its\n",
        "black bulk was thrown on the smooth wall. Then slowly it receded, and once more the dais was etched\n",
        "darkly against the wall. But the sleeper was no longer upon it.\n",
        "An hysterical gurgle rose in Natala's throat, and Conan gave her an admonitory shake. He was aware of\n",
        "an iciness in his own veins. Human foes he did not fear; anything understandable, however grisly, caused\n",
        "no tremors in his broad breast. But this was beyond his ken.\n",
        "After a while, however, his curiosity conquered his uneasiness, and he moved out into the unlighted\n",
        "chamber again, ready for anything. Looking into the other room, he saw it was empty. The dais stood as\n",
        "he had first seen it, except that no bejeweled human lay thereon. Only on its silken covering shone a\n",
        "single drop of blood, like a great crimson gem. Natala saw it and gave a low choking cry, for which\n",
        "Conan did not punish her. Again he felt the icy hand of fear. On that dais a man had lain; something had\n",
        "crept into the chamber and carried him away. What that something was, Conan had no idea, but an aura\n",
        "of unnatural horror hung over those dim-lit chambers.\n",
        "He was ready to depart. Taking Natala's hand, he turned back, then hesitated. Somewhere back among\n",
        "the chambers they had traversed, he heard the sound of a footfall. A human foot, bare or softly shod, had \n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "92\n",
        "made that sound, and Conan, with the wariness of a wolf, turned quickly aside. He believed he could\n",
        "come again into the outer court, and yet avoid the room from which the sound had appeared to come.\n",
        "But they had not crossed the first chamber on their new route, when the rustle of a silken hanging\n",
        "brought them about suddenly. Before a curtained alcove stood a man eyeing them intently.\n",
        "He was exactly like the others they had encountered: tall, well made, clad in purple garments, with a\n",
        "jeweled girdle. There was neither surprize nor hostility in his amber eyes. They were dreamy as a lotuseater's. He did not draw the short sword at his side. After a tense moment he spoke, in a far-away\n",
        "detached tone, and a language his hearers did not understand.\n",
        "On a venture Conan replied in Stygian, and the stranger answered in the same tongue: \"Who are you?\"\n",
        "\"I am Conan, a Cimmerian,\" answered the barbarian. \"This is Natala, of Brythunia. What city is this?\"\n",
        "The man did not at once reply. His dreamy sensuous gaze rested on Natala, and he drawled, \"Of all my\n",
        "rich visions, this is the strangest! Oh, girl of the golden locks, from what far dreamland do you come?\n",
        "From Andarra, or Tothra, or Kuth of the star-girdle?\"\n",
        "\"What madness is this?\" growled the Cimmerian harshly, not relishing the man's words or manner.\n",
        "The other did not heed him.\n",
        "\"I have dreamed more gorgeous beauties,\" he murmured; \"lithe women with hair dusky as night, and\n",
        "dark eyes of unfathomed mystery. But your skin is white as milk, your eyes as clear as dawn, and there is\n",
        "about you a freshness and daintiness alluring as honey. Come to my couch, little dream-girl!\"\n",
        "He advanced and reached for her, and Conan struck aside his hand with a force that might have broken\n",
        "his arm. The man reeled back, clutching the numbed member, his eyes clouding.\n",
        "\"What rebellion of ghosts is this?\" he muttered. \"Barbarian, I command ye--begone! Fade! Dissipate! Fade!\n",
        "Vanish!\"\n",
        "\"I'll vanish your head from your shoulders!\" snarled the infuriated Cimmerian, his saber gleaming in his\n",
        "hand. \"Is this the welcome you give strangers? By Crom, I'll drench these hangings in blood!\"\n",
        "The dreaminess had faded from the other's eyes, to be replaced by a look of bewilderment.\n",
        "\"Thog!\" he ejaculated. \"You are real! Whence come you? Who are you? What do you in Xuthal?\"\n",
        "\"We came from the desert,\" Conan growled. \"We wandered into the city at dusk, famishing. We found a\n",
        "feast set for some one, and we ate it. I have no money to pay for it. In my country, no starving man is\n",
        "denied food, but you civilized people must have your recompense--if you are like all I ever met. We have\n",
        "done no harm and we were just leaving. By Crom, I do not like this place, where dead men rise, and\n",
        "sleeping men vanish into the bellies of shadows!\"\n",
        "The man started violently at the last comment, his yellow face turning ashy.\n",
        "\"What do you say? Shadows? Into the bellies of shadows?\"\n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "93\n",
        "\"Well,\" answered the Cimmerian cautiously, \"whatever it is that takes a man from a sleeping-dais and\n",
        "leaves only a spot of blood.\"\n",
        "\"You have seen? You have seen?\" The man was shaking like a leaf; his voice cracked on the high-pitched\n",
        "note.\n",
        "\"Only a man sleeping on a dais, and a shadow that engulfed him,\" answered Conan.\n",
        "The effect of his words on the other was horrifying. With an awful scream the man turned and rushed\n",
        "from the chamber. In his blind haste he caromed from the side of the door, righted himself, and fled\n",
        "through the adjoining chambers, still screaming at the top of his voice. Amazed, Conan stared after him,\n",
        "the girl trembling as she clutched the giant's arm. They could no longer see the flying figure, but they still\n",
        "heard his frightful screams, dwindling in the distance, and echoing as from vaulted roofs. Suddenly one\n",
        "cry, louder than the others, rose and broke short, followed by blank silence.\n",
        "\"Crom!\"\n",
        "Conan wiped the perspiration from his forehead with a hand that was not entirely steady.\n",
        "\"Surely this is a city of the mad! Let's get out of here, before we meet other madmen!\"\n",
        "\"It is all a nightmare!\" whimpered Natala. \"We are dead and damned! We died out on the desert and are\n",
        "in hell! We are disembodied spirits--ow!\" Her yelp was induced by a resounding spank from Conan's\n",
        "open hand.\n",
        "\"You're no spirit when a pat makes you yell like that,\" he commented, with the grim humor which\n",
        "frequently manifested itself at inopportune times. \"We are alive, though we may not be if we loiter in this\n",
        "devil-haunted pile. Come!\"\n",
        "They had traversed but a single chamber when again they stopped short. Some one or something was\n",
        "approaching. They faced the doorway whence the sounds came, waiting for they knew not what. Conan's\n",
        "nostrils widened, and his eyes narrowed. He caught the faint scent of the perfume he had noticed earlier\n",
        "in the night. A figure framed itself in the doorway. Conan swore under his breath; Natala's red lips\n",
        "opened wide.\n",
        "It was a woman who stood there staring at them in wonder. She was tall, lithe, shaped like a goddess;\n",
        "clad in a narrow girdle crusted with jewels. A burnished mass of night-black hair set off the whiteness of\n",
        "her ivory body. Her dark eyes, shaded by long dusky lashes, were deep with sensuous mystery. Conan\n",
        "caught his breath at her beauty, and Natala stared with dilated eyes. The Cimmerian had never seen such\n",
        "a woman; her facial outline was Stygian, but she was not dusky-skinned like the Stygian women he had\n",
        "known; her limbs were like alabaster.\n",
        "But when she spoke, in a deep rich musical voice, it was in the Stygian tongue.\n",
        "\"Who are you? What do you in Xuthal? Who is that girl?\"\n",
        "\"Who are you?\" bluntly countered Conan, who quickly wearied of answering questions.\n",
        "\"I am Thalis the Stygian,\" she replied. \"Are you mad, to come here?\"\n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "94\n",
        "\"I've been thinking I must be,\" he growled. \"By Crom, if I am sane, I'm out of place here, because these\n",
        "people are all maniacs. We stagger in from the desert, dying of thirst and hunger, and we come upon a\n",
        "dead man who tries to stab me in the back. We enter a palace rich and luxuriant, yet apparently empty.\n",
        "We find a meal set, but with no feasters. Then we see a shadow devour a sleeping man--\" He watched her\n",
        "narrowly and saw her change color slightly. \"Well?\"\n",
        "\"Well what?\" she demanded, apparently regaining control of herself.\n",
        "\"I was just waiting for you to run through the rooms howling like a wild woman,\" he answered. \"The\n",
        "man I told about the shadow did.\"\n",
        "She shrugged her slim ivory shoulders. \"That was the screams I heard, then. Well, to every man his fate,\n",
        "and it's foolish to squeal like a rat in a trap. When Thog wants me, he will come for me.\"\n",
        "\"Who is Thog?\" demanded Conan suspiciously.\n",
        "She gave him a long appraising stare that brought color to Natala's face and made her bite her small red\n",
        "lip.\n",
        "\"Sit down on that divan and I will tell you,\" she said. \"But first tell me your names.\"\n",
        "\"I am Conan, a Cimmerian, and this is Natala, a daughter of Brythunia,\" he answered. \"We are refugees of\n",
        "an army destroyed on the borders of Kush. But I am not desirous of sitting down, where black shadows\n",
        "might steal up on my back.\"\n",
        "With a light musical laugh, she seated herself, stretching out her supple limbs with studied abandon.\n",
        "\"Be at ease,\" she advised. \"If Thog wishes you, he will take you, wherever you are. That man you\n",
        "mentioned, who screamed and ran--did you not hear him give one great cry, and then fall silent? In his\n",
        "frenzy, he must have run full into that which he sought to escape. No man can avoid his fate.\"\n",
        "Conan grunted non-committally, but he sat down on the edge of a couch, his saber across his knees, his\n",
        "eyes wandering suspiciously about the chamber. Natala nestled against him, clutching him jealously, her\n",
        "legs tucked up under her. She eyed the stranger woman with suspicion and resentment. She felt small\n",
        "and dust-stained and insignificant before this glamorous beauty, and she could not mistake the look in\n",
        "the dark eyes which feasted on every detail of the bronzed giant's physique.\n",
        "\"What is this place, and who are these people?\" demanded Conan.\n",
        "\"This city is called Xuthal; it is very ancient. It is built over an oasis, which the founders of Xuthal found\n",
        "in their wanderings. They came from the east, so long ago that not even their descendants remember the\n",
        "age.\"\n",
        "\"Surely there are not many of them; these palaces seem empty.\"\n",
        "\"No; and yet more than you might think. The city is really one great palace, with every building inside\n",
        "the walls closely connected with the others. You might walk among these chambers for hours and see no\n",
        "one. At other times, you would meet hundreds of the inhabitants.\"\n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "95\n",
        "\"How is that?\" Conan inquired uneasily; this savored too strongly of sorcery for comfort.\n",
        "\"Much of the time these people lie in sleep. Their dream-life is as important--and to them as real--as their\n",
        "waking life. You have heard of the black lotus? In certain pits of the city it grows. Through the ages they\n",
        "have cultivated it, until, instead of death, its juice induces dreams, gorgeous and fantastic. In these\n",
        "dreams they spend most of their time. Their lives are vague, erratic, and without plan. They dream, they\n",
        "wake, drink, love, eat and dream again. They seldom finish anything they begin, but leave it half\n",
        "completed and sink back again into the slumber of the black lotus. That meal you found--doubtless one\n",
        "awoke, felt the urge of hunger, prepared the meal for himself, then forgot about it and wandered away to\n",
        "dream again.\"\n",
        "\"Where do they get their food?\" interrupted Conan. \"I saw no fields or vineyards outside the city. Have\n",
        "they orchards and cattle-pens within the walls?\"\n",
        "She shook her head. \"They manufacture their own food out of the primal elements. They are wonderful\n",
        "scientists, when they are not drugged with their dream-flower. Their ancestors were mental giants, who\n",
        "built this marvelous city in the desert, and though the race became slaves to their curious passions, some\n",
        "of their wonderful knowledge still remains. Have you wondered about these lights? They are jewels,\n",
        "fused with radium. You rub them with your thumb to make them glow, and rub them again, the opposite\n",
        "way, to extinguish them. That is but a single example of their science. But much they have forgotten.\n",
        "They take little interest in waking life, choosing to lie most of the time in death-like sleep.\"\n",
        "\"Then the dead man at the gate--\" began Conan.\n",
        "\"Was doubtless slumbering. Sleepers of the lotus are like the dead. Animation is apparently suspended. It\n",
        "is impossible to detect the slightest sign of life. The spirit has left the body and is roaming at will through\n",
        "other, exotic worlds. The man at the gate was a good example of the irresponsibility of these people's\n",
        "lives. He was guarding the gate, where custom decrees a watch be kept, though no enemy has ever\n",
        "advanced across the desert. In other parts of the city you would find other guards, generally sleeping as\n",
        "soundly as the man at the gate.\"\n",
        "Conan mulled over this for a space.\n",
        "\"Where are the people now?\"\n",
        "\"Scattered in different parts of the city; lying on couches, on silken divans, in cushion-littered alcoves, on\n",
        "fur-covered daises; all wrapt in the shining veil of dreams.\"\n",
        "Conan felt the skin twitch between his massive shoulders. It was not soothing to think of hundreds of\n",
        "people lying cold and still throughout the tapestried palaces, their glassy eyes turned unseeingly upward.\n",
        "He remembered something else.\n",
        "\"What of the thing that stole through the chambers and carried away the man on the dais?\"\n",
        "A shudder twitched her ivory limbs.\n",
        "\"That was Thog, the Ancient, the god of Xuthal, who dwells in the sunken dome in the center of the city.\n",
        "He has always dwelt in Xuthal. Whether he came here with the ancient founders, or was here when they\n",
        "built the city, none knows. But the people of Xuthal worship him. Mostly he sleeps below the city, but \n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "96\n",
        "sometimes at irregular intervals he grows hungry, and then he steals through the secret corridors and the\n",
        "dim-lit chambers, seeking prey. Then none is safe.\"\n",
        "Natala moaned with terror and clasped Conan's mighty neck as if to resist an effort to drag her from her\n",
        "protector's side.\n",
        "\"Crom!\" he ejaculated aghast. \"You mean to tell me these people lie down calmly and sleep, with this\n",
        "demon crawling among them?\"\n",
        "\"It is only occasionally that he is hungry,\" she repeated. \"A god must have his sacrifices. When I was a\n",
        "child in Stygia, the people lived under the shadow of the priests. None ever knew when he or she would\n",
        "be seized and dragged to the altar. What difference whether the priests give a victim to the gods, or the\n",
        "god comes for his own victim?\"\n",
        "\"Such is not the custom of my people,\" Conan growled, \"nor of Natala's either. The Hyborians do not\n",
        "sacrifice humans to their god, Mitra, and as for my people--by Crom, I'd like to see a priest try to drag a\n",
        "Cimmerian to the altar! There'd be blood spilt, but not as the priest intended.\"\n",
        "\"You are a barbarian,\" laughed Thalis, but with a glow in her luminous eyes. \"Thog is very ancient and\n",
        "very terrible.\"\n",
        "\"These folk must be either fools or heroes,\" grunted Conan, \"to lie down and dream their idiotic dreams,\n",
        "knowing they might awaken in his belly.\"\n",
        "She laughed. \"They know nothing else. For untold generations Thog has preyed on them. He has been\n",
        "one of the factors which have reduced their numbers from thousands to hundreds. A few more\n",
        "generations and they will be extinct, and Thog must either fare forth into the world for new prey, or retire\n",
        "to the underworld whence he came so long ago.\n",
        "\"They realize their ultimate doom, but they are fatalists, incapable of resistance or escape. Not one of the\n",
        "present generation has been out of sight of these walls. There is an oasis a day's march to the south--I\n",
        "have seen it on the old maps their ancestors drew on parchment--but no man of Xuthal has visited it for\n",
        "three generations, much less made any attempt to explore the fertile grasslands which the maps show\n",
        "lying another day's march beyond it. They are a fast-fading race, drowned in lotus dreams, stimulating\n",
        "their waking hours by means of the golden wine which heals wounds, prolongs life, and invigorates the\n",
        "most sated debauchee.\n",
        "\"Yet they cling to life, and fear the deity they worship. You saw how one went mad at the knowledge that\n",
        "Thog was roving the palaces. I have seen the whole city screaming and tearing its hair, and running\n",
        "frenziedly out of the gates, to cower outside the walls and draw lots to see which would be bound and\n",
        "flung back through the arched doorways to satisfy Thog's lust and hunger. Were they not all slumbering\n",
        "now, the word of his coming would send them raving and shrieking again through the outer gates.\"\n",
        "\"Oh, Conan!\" begged Natala hysterically. \"Let us flee!\"\n",
        "\"In good time,\" muttered Conan, his eyes burning on Thalis ivory limbs. \"What are you, a Stygian woman,\n",
        "doing here?\"\n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "97\n",
        "\"I came here when a young girl,\" she answered, leaning lithely back against the velvet divan, and\n",
        "intertwining her slender fingers behind her dusky head. \"I am the daughter of a king, no common woman,\n",
        "as you can see by my skin, which is as white as that of your little blond there. I was abducted by a rebel\n",
        "prince, who, with an army of Kushite bowmen, pushed southward into the wilderness, searching for a\n",
        "land he could make his own. He and all his warriors perished in the desert, but one, before he died,\n",
        "placed me on a camel and walked beside it until he dropped and died in his tracks. The beast wandered\n",
        "on, and I finally passed into delirium from thirst and hunger, and awakened in this city. They told me I\n",
        "had been seen from the walls, early in the dawn, lying senseless beside a dead camel. They went forth\n",
        "and brought me in and revived me with their wonderful golden wine. And only the sight of a woman\n",
        "would have led them to have ventured that far from their walls.\n",
        "\"They were naturally much interested in me, especially the men. As I could not speak their language, they\n",
        "learned to speak mine. They are very quick and able of intellect; they learned my language long before I\n",
        "learned theirs. But they were more interested in me than in my language. I have been, and am, the only\n",
        "thing for which a man of them will forgo his lotus-dreams for a space.\"\n",
        "She laughed wickedly, flashing her audacious eyes meaningly at Conan.\n",
        "\"Of course the women are jealous of me,\" she continued tranquilly. \"They are handsome enough in their\n",
        "yellow-skinned way, but they are dreamy and uncertain as the men, and these latter like me not only for\n",
        "my beauty, but for my reality. I am no dream! Though I have dreamed the dreams of the lotus, I am a\n",
        "normal woman, with earthly emotions and desires. With such these moon-eyed yellow women can not\n",
        "compare.\n",
        "\"That is why it would be better for you to cut that girl's throat with your saber, before the men of Xuthal\n",
        "waken and catch her. They will put her through paces she never dreamed of! She is too soft to endure\n",
        "what I have thrived on. I am a daughter of Luxur, and before I had known fifteen summers I had been led\n",
        "through the temples of Derketo, the dusky goddess, and had been initiated into the mysteries. Not that\n",
        "my first years in Xuthal were years of unmodified pleasure! The people of Xuthal have forgotten more\n",
        "than the priestesses of Derketo ever dreamed. They live only for sensual joys. Dreaming or waking, their\n",
        "lives are filled with exotic ecstasies, beyond the ken of ordinary men.\"\n",
        "\"Damned degenerates!\" growled Conan.\n",
        "\"It is all in the point of view,\" smiled Thalis lazily.\n",
        "\"Well,\" he decided, \"we're merely wasting time. I can see this is no place for ordinary mortals. We'll be\n",
        "gone before your morons awake, or Thog comes to devour us. I think the desert would be kinder.\"\n",
        "Natala, whose blood had curdled in her veins at Thalis's words, fervently agreed. She could speak\n",
        "Stygian only brokenly, but she understood it well enough. Conan stood up, drawing her up beside him.\n",
        "\"If you'll show us the nearest way out of this city,\" he grunted, \"we'll take ourselves off.\" But his gaze\n",
        "lingered on the Stygian's sleek limbs and ivory breasts.\n",
        "She did not miss his look, and she smiled enigmatically as she rose with the lithe ease of a great lazy cat.\n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "98\n",
        "\"Follow me,\" she directed and led the way, conscious of Conan's eyes fixed on her supple figure and\n",
        "perfectly poised carriage. She did not go the way they had come, but before Conan's suspicions could be\n",
        "roused, she halted in a wide ivory-cased chamber, and pointed to a tiny fountain which gurgled in the\n",
        "center of the ivory floor.\n",
        "\"Don't you want to wash your face, child?\" she asked Natala. \"It is stained with dust, and there is dust in\n",
        "your hair.\"\n",
        "Natala colored resentfully at the suggestion of malice in the Stygian's faintly mocking tone, but she\n",
        "complied, wondering miserably just how much havoc the desert sun and wind had wrought on her\n",
        "complexion--a feature for which women of her race were justly noted. She knelt beside the fountain,\n",
        "shook back her hair, slipped her tunic down to her waist, and began to lave not only her face, but her\n",
        "white arms and shoulders as well.\n",
        "\"By Crom!\" grumbled Conan. \"A woman will stop to consider her beauty, if the devil himself were on her\n",
        "heels. Haste, girl; you'll be dusty again before we've got out of sight of this city. And Thalis, I'd take it\n",
        "kindly if you'd furnish us with a bit of food and drink.\"\n",
        "For answer Thalis leaned herself against him, slipping one white arm about his bronzed shoulders. Her\n",
        "sleek naked flank pressed against his thigh and the perfume of her foamy hair was in his nostrils.\n",
        "\"Why dare the desert?\" she whispered urgently. \"Stay here! I will teach you the ways of Xuthal. I will\n",
        "protect you. I will love you! You are a real man: I am sick of these moon-calves who sigh and dream and\n",
        "wake, and dream again. I am hungry for the hard, clean passion of a man from the earth. The blaze of\n",
        "your dynamic eyes makes my heart pound in my bosom, and the touch of your iron-thewed arm\n",
        "maddens me.\n",
        "\"Stay here! I will make you king of Xuthal! I will show you all the ancient mysteries, and the exotic ways\n",
        "of pleasure! I--\" She had thrown both arms about his neck and was standing on tiptoe, her vibrant body\n",
        "shivering against his. Over her ivory shoulder he saw Natala, throwing back her damp tousled hair, stop\n",
        "short, her lovely eyes dilating, her red lips parting in a shocked O. With an embarrassed grunt, Conan\n",
        "disengaged Thalis's clinging arms and put her aside with one massive arm. She threw a swift glance at\n",
        "the Brythunian girl and smiled enigmatically, seeming to nod her splendid head in mysterious cogitation.\n",
        "Natala rose and jerked up her tunic, her eyes blazing, her lips pouting sulkily. Conan swore under his\n",
        "breath. He was no more monogamous in his nature than the average soldier of fortune, but there was an\n",
        "innate decency about him that was Natala's best protection.\n",
        "Thalis did not press her suit. Beckoning them with her slender hand to follow, she turned and walked\n",
        "across the chamber.\n",
        "There, close to the tapestried wall, she halted suddenly. Conan, watching her, wondered if she had heard\n",
        "the sounds that might be made by a nameless monster stealing through the midnight chambers, and his\n",
        "skin crawled at the thought.\n",
        "\"What do you hear?\" he demanded.\n",
        "\"Watch that doorway,\" she replied, pointing.\n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "99\n",
        "He wheeled, sword ready. Only the empty arch of the entrance met his gaze. Then behind him sounded a\n",
        "quick faint scuffling noise, a half-choked gasp. He whirled. Thalis and Natala had vanished. The tapestry\n",
        "was settling back in place, as if it had been lifted away from the wall. As he gaped bewilderedly, from\n",
        "behind that tapestried wall rang a muffled scream in the voice of the Brythunian girl.\n",
        "II\n",
        "\n",
        "When Conan turned, in compliance with Thalis's request, to glare at the doorway opposite, Natala had\n",
        "been standing just behind him, close to the side of the Stygian. The instant the Cimmerian's back was\n",
        "turned, Thalis, with a pantherish quickness almost incredible, clapped her hand over Natala's mouth,\n",
        "stifling the cry she tried to give. Simultaneously the Stygian's other arm was passed about the blond girl's\n",
        "supple waist, and she was jerked back against the wall, which seemed to give way as Thalis's shoulder\n",
        "pressed against it. A section of the wall swung inward, and through a slit that opened in the tapestry\n",
        "Thalis slid with her captive, just as Conan wheeled back.\n",
        "Inside was utter blackness as the secret door swung to again. Thalis paused to fumble at it for an instant,\n",
        "apparently sliding home a bolt, and as she took her hand from Natala's mouth to perform this act, the\n",
        "Brythunian girl began to scream at the top of her voice. Thalis's laugh was like poisoned honey in the\n",
        "darkness.\n",
        "\"Scream if you will, little fool. It will only shorten your life.\"\n",
        "At that Natala ceased suddenly, and cowered shaking in every limb.\n",
        "\"Why did you do this?\" she begged. \"What are you going to do?\"\n",
        "\"I am going to take you down this corridor for a short distance,\" answered Thalis, \"and leave you for one\n",
        "who will sooner or later come for you.\"\n",
        "\"Ohhhhhh!\" Natala's voice broke in a sob of terror. \"Why should you harm me? I have never injured you!\"\n",
        "\"I want your warrior. You stand in my way. He desires me--I could read the look in his eyes. But for you,\n",
        "he would be willing to stay here and be my king. When you are out of the way, he will follow me.\"\n",
        "\"He will cut your throat,\" answered Natala with conviction, knowing Conan better than Thalis did.\n",
        "\"We shall see,\" answered the Stygian coolly from the confidence of her power over men. \"At any rate, you\n",
        "will not know whether he stabs or kisses me, because you will be the bride of him who dwells in\n",
        "darkness. Come!\"\n",
        "Half mad with terror, Natala fought like a wild thing, but it availed her nothing. With a lithe strength she\n",
        "would not have believed possible in a woman, Thalis picked her up and carried her down the black\n",
        "corridor as if she had been a child. Natala did not scream again, remembering the Stygian's sinister words;\n",
        "the only sounds were her desperate quick panting and Thalis's soft taunting lascivious laughter. Then the \n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",

        "Brythunian's fluttering hand closed on something in the dark--a jeweled dagger hilt jutting from Thalis's\n",
        "gem-crusted girdle. Natala jerked it forth and struck blindly and with all her girlish power.\n",
        "A scream burst from Thalis's lips, feline in its pain and fury. She reeled, and Natala slipped from her\n",

        "courage. Never much of a fighter, the darkness, violence and horror of her adventure had left her limp,\n",

        "touching the floor. Twisting her head, Natala saw Thalis unhook a jewel-handled whip from where it\n",
        "hung on the wall, near the ring. The lashes consisted of seven round silk cords, harder yet more pliant\n",

        "\"Open the door, girl,\" he muttered thickly. \"The men of Xuthal will be waiting for us, and I would not\n",
        "disappoint them. By Crom, the city has not seen such a sacrifice as I will make!\"\n",
        "She knew he was half delirious. No sound came from beyond the door. Taking the radium gem from his\n",
        "blood-stained hand, she threw the bolt and drew the panel inward. The inner side of a cloth-of-gold\n",
        "tapestry met her gaze and she drew it aside and peeked through, her heart in her mouth. She was looking\n",
        "into an empty chamber in the center of which a silvery fountain tinkled.\n",
        "Conan's hand fell heavily on her naked shoulder.\n",
        "\"Stand aside, girl,\" he mumbled. \"Now is the feasting of swords.\"\n",
        "\"There is no one in the chamber,\" she answered. \"But there is water--\"\n",
        "\"I hear it,\" he licked his blackened lips. \"We will drink before we die.\"\n",
        "He seemed blinded. She took his darkly stained hand and led him through the stone door. She went on\n",
        "tiptoe, expecting a rush of yellow figures through the arches at any instant.\n",
        "\"Drink while I keep watch,\" he muttered.\n",
        "\"No, I am not thirsty. Lie down beside the fountain and I will bathe your wounds.\"\n",
        "\"What of the swords of Xuthal?\" He continually raked his arm across his eyes as if to clear his blurred\n",
        "sight.\n",
        "\"I hear no one. All is silent.\"\n",
        "He sank down gropingly and plunged his face into the crystal jet, drinking as if he could not get enough.\n",
        "When he raised his head there was sanity in his bloodshot eyes and he stretched his massive limbs out on\n",
        "the marble floor as she requested, though he kept his saber in his hand, and his eyes continually roved\n",
        "toward the archways. She bathed his torn flesh and bandaged the deeper wounds with strips torn from a\n",
        "silk hanging. She shuddered at the appearance of his back; the flesh was discolored, mottled and spotted \n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "108\n",
        "black and blue and a sickly yellow, where it was not raw. As she worked she sought frantically for a\n",
        "solution to their problem. If they stayed where they were, they would eventually be discovered. Whether\n",
        "the men of Xuthal were searching the palaces for them, or had returned to their dreams, she could not\n",
        "know.\n",
        "As she finished her task, she froze. Under the hanging that partly concealed an alcove, she saw a hand's\n",
        "breadth of yellow flesh.\n",
        "Saying nothing to Conan, she rose and crossed the chamber softly, grasping his poniard. Her heart\n",
        "pounded suffocatingly as she cautiously drew aside the hanging. On the dais lay a young yellow woman,\n",
        "naked and apparently lifeless. At her hand stood a jade jar nearly full of peculiar golden-colored liquid.\n",
        "Natala believed it to be the elixir described by Thalis, which lent vigor and vitality to the degenerate\n",
        "Xuthal. She leaned across the supine form and grasped the vessel, her poniard poised over the girl's\n",
        "bosom. The latter did not wake.\n",
        "With the jar in her possession, Natala hesitated, realizing it would be the safer course to put the sleeping\n",
        "girl beyond the power of waking and raising an alarm. But she could not bring herself to plunge the\n",
        "Cimmerian poniard into that still bosom, and at last she drew back the hanging and returned to Conan,\n",
        "who lay where she had left him, seemingly only partly conscious.\n",
        "She bent and placed the jar to his lips. He drank, mechanically at first, then with a suddenly roused\n",
        "interest. To her amazement he sat up and took the vessel from her hands. When he lifted his face, his eyes\n",
        "were clear and normal. Much of the drawn haggard look had gone from his features, and his voice was\n",
        "not the mumble of delirium.\n",
        "\"Crom! Where did you get this?\"\n",
        "She pointed. \"From that alcove, where a yellow hussy is sleeping.\"\n",
        "He thrust his muzzle again into the golden liquid.\n",
        "\"By Crom,\" he said with a deep sigh, \"I feel new life and power rush like wildfire through my veins.\n",
        "Surely this is the very elixir of Life!\"\n",
        "\"We had best go back into the corridor,\" Natala ventured nervously. \"We shall be discovered if we stay\n",
        "here long. We can hide there until your wounds heal--\"\n",
        "\"Not I,\" he grunted. \"We are not rats, to hide in dark burrows. We leave this devil-city now, and let none\n",
        "seek to stop us.\"\n",
        "\"But your wounds!\" she wailed.\n",
        "\"I do not feel them,\" he answered. \"It may be a false strength this liquor has given me, but I swear I am\n",
        "aware of neither pain nor weakness.\"\n",
        "With sudden purpose he crossed the chamber to a window she had not noticed. Over his shoulder she\n",
        "looked out. A cool breeze tossed her tousled locks. Above was the dark velvet sky, clustered with stars.\n",
        "Below them stretched a vague expanse of sand.\n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "109\n",
        "\"Thalis said the city was one great palace,\" said Conan. \"Evidently some of the chambers are built like\n",
        "towers on the wall. This one is. Chance has led us well.\"\n",
        "\"What do you mean?\" she asked, glancing apprehensively over her shoulder.\n",
        "\"There is a crystal jar on that ivory table,\" he answered. \"Fill it with water and tie a strip of that torn\n",
        "hanging about its neck for a handle while I rip up this tapestry.\"\n",
        "She obeyed without question, and when she turned from her task she saw Conan rapidly tying together\n",
        "the long, tough strips of silk to make a rope, one end of which he fastened to the leg of the massive ivory\n",
        "table.\n",
        "\"We'll take our chance with the desert,\" said he. \"Thalis spoke of an oasis a day's march to the south, and\n",
        "grasslands beyond that. If we reach the oasis we can rest until my wounds heal. This wine is like sorcery.\n",
        "A little while ago I was little more than a dead man; now I am ready for anything. Here is enough silk left\n",
        "for you to make a garment of.\"\n",
        "Natala had forgotten her nudity. The mere fact caused her no qualms, but her delicate skin would need\n",
        "protection from the desert sun. As she knotted the silk length about her supple body, Conan turned to the\n",
        "window and with a contemptuous wrench tore away the soft gold bars that guarded it. Then, looping the\n",
        "loose end of his silk rope about Natala's hips, and cautioning her to hold on with both hands, he lifted her\n",
        "through the window and lowered her the thirty-odd feet to the earth. She stepped out of the loop, and\n",
        "drawing it back up, he made fast the vessels of water and wine, and lowered them to her. He followed\n",
        "them, sliding down swiftly, hand over hand.\n",
        "As he reached her side, Natala gave a sigh of relief. They stood alone at the foot of the great wall, the\n",
        "paling stars overhead and the naked desert about them. What perils yet confronted them she could not\n",
        "know, but her heart sang with joy because they were out of that ghostly, unreal city.\n",
        "\"They may find the rope,\" grunted Conan, slinging the precious jars across his shoulders, wincing at the\n",
        "contact with his mangled flesh. \"They may even pursue us, but from what Thalis said, I doubt it. That\n",
        "way is south,\" a bronze muscular arm indicated their course; \"so somewhere in that direction lies the\n",
        "oasis. Come!\"\n",
        "Taking her hand with a thoughtfulness unusual for him, Conan strode out across the sands, suiting his\n",
        "stride to the shorter legs of his companion. He did not glance back at the silent city, brooding dreamily\n",
        "and ghostily behind them.\n",
        "\"Conan,\" Natala ventured finally, \"when you fought the monster, and later, as you came up the corridor,\n",
        "did you see anything of--of Thalis?\"\n",
        "He shook his head. \"It was dark in the corridor; but it was empty.\"\n",
        "She shuddered. \"She tortured me--yet I pity her.\"\n",
        "\"It was a hot welcome we got in that accursed city,\" he snarled. Then his grim humor returned. \"Well,\n",
        "they'll remember our visit long enough, I'll wager. There are brains and guts and blood to be cleaned off\n",
        "the marble tiles, and if their god still lives, he carries more wounds than I. We got off light, after all: we \n",
        "The Slithering Shadow\n",
        "110\n",
        "have wine and water and a good chance of reaching a habitable country, though I look as if I've gone\n",
        "through a meatgrinder, and you have a sore--\"\n",
        "\"It's all your fault,\" she interrupted. \"If you had not looked so long and admiringly at that Stygian cat--\"\n",
        "\"Crom and his devils!\" he swore. \"When the oceans drown the world, women will take time for jealousy.\n",
        "Devil take their conceit! Did I tell the Stygian to fall in love with me? After all, she was only human!\"\n",
        "THE END\n",
        "111\n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "I\n",
        "\n",
        "Into the west, unknown of man,\n",
        "Ships have sailed since the world began. Read, if you dare, what Skelos wrote,\n",
        "With dead hands fumbling his silken coat;\n",
        "And follow the ships through the wind-blown wrack\n",
        "Follow the ships that come not back.\n",
        "Sancha, once of Kordava, yawned daintily, stretched her supple limbs luxuriously, and composed herself\n",
        "more comfortably on the ermine-fringed silk spread on the carack's poop-deck. That the crew watched\n",
        "her with burning interest from waist and forecastle she was lazily aware, just as she was also aware that\n",
        "her short silk kirtle veiled little of her voluptuous contours from their eager eyes. Wherefore she smiled\n",
        "insolently and prepared to snatch a few more winks before the sun, which was just thrusting his golden\n",
        "disk above the ocean, should dazzle her eyes.\n",
        "But at that instant a sound reached her ears unlike the creaking of timbers, thrum of cordage and lap of\n",
        "waves. She sat up, her gaze fixed on the rail, over which, to her amazement, a dripping figure clambered.\n",
        "Her dark eyes opened wide, her red lips parted in an O of surprize. The intruder was a stranger to her.\n",
        "Water ran in rivulets from his great shoulders and down his heavy arms. His single garment--a pair of\n",
        "bright crimson silk breeks--was soaking wet, as was his broad gold-buckled girdle and the sheathed\n",
        "sword it supported. As he stood at the rail, the rising sun etched him like a great bronze statue. He ran\n",
        "his fingers through his streaming black mane, and his blue eyes lit as they rested on the girl.\n",
        "\"Who are you?\" she demanded. \"Whence did you come?\"\n",
        "He made a gesture toward the sea that took in a whole quarter of the compass, while his eyes did not\n",
        "leave her supple figure.\n",
        "\"Are you a merman, that you rise up out of the sea?\" she asked, confused by the candor of his gaze,\n",
        "though she was accustomed to admiration.\n",
        "Before he could reply, a quick step sounded on the boards, and the master of the carack was glaring at the\n",
        "stranger, fingers twitching at sword-hilt.\n",
        "\"Who the devil are you, sirrah?\" this one demanded in no friendly tone.\n",
        "\"I am Conan,\" the other answered imperturbably. Sancha pricked up her ears anew; she had never heard\n",
        "Zingaran spoken with such an accent as the stranger spoke it.\n",
        "\"And how did you get aboard my ship?\" The voice grated with suspicion.\n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "112\n",
        "\"I swam.\"\n",
        "\"Swam!\" exclaimed the master angrily. \"Dog, would you jest with me? We are far beyond sight of land.\n",
        "Whence do you come?\"\n",
        "Conan pointed with a muscular brown arm toward the east, banded in dazzling gold by the lifting sun.\n",
        "\"I came from the Islands.\"\n",
        "\"Oh!\" The other regarded him with increased interest. Black brows drew down over scowling eyes, and\n",
        "the thin lip lifted unpleasantly.\n",
        "\"So you are one of those dogs of the Barachans.\"\n",
        "A faint smile touched Conan's lips.\n",
        "\"And do you know who I am?\" his questioner demanded.\n",
        "\"This ship is the Wastrel; so you must be Zaporavo.\"\n",
        "\"Aye!\" It touched the captain's grim vanity that the man should know him. He was a tall man, tall as\n",
        "Conan, though of leaner build. Framed in his steel morion his face was dark, saturnine and hawk-like,\n",
        "wherefore men called him the Hawk. His armor and garments were rich and ornate, after the fashion of a\n",
        "Zingaran grandee. His hand was never far from his sword-hilt.\n",
        "There was little favor in the gaze he bent on Conan. Little love was lost between Zingaran renegades and\n",
        "the outlaws who infested the Baracha Islands off the southern coast of Zingara. These men were mostly\n",
        "sailors from Argos, with a sprinkling of other nationalities. They raided the shipping, and harried the\n",
        "Zingaran coast towns, just as the Zingaran buccaneers did, but these dignified their profession by calling\n",
        "themselves Freebooters, while they dubbed the Barachans pirates. They were neither the first nor the last\n",
        "to gild the name of thief.\n",
        "Some of these thoughts passed through Zaporavo's mind as he toyed with his sword-hilt and scowled at\n",
        "his uninvited guest. Conan gave no hint of what his own thoughts might be. He stood with folded arms\n",
        "as placidly as if upon his own deck; his lips smiled and his eyes were untroubled.\n",
        "\"What are you doing here?\" the Freebooter demanded abruptly.\n",
        "\"I found it necessary to leave the rendezvous at Tortage before moonrise last night,\" answered Conan. \"I\n",
        "departed in a leaky boat, and rowed and bailed all night. Just at dawn I saw your topsails, and left the\n",
        "miserable tub to sink, while I made better speed in the water.\"\n",
        "\"There are sharks in these waters,\" growled Zaporavo, and was vaguely irritated by the answering shrug\n",
        "of the mighty shoulders. A glance toward the waist showed a screen of eager faces staring upward. A\n",
        "word would send them leaping up on the poop in a storm of swords that would overwhelm even such a\n",
        "fightingman as the stranger looked to be.\n",
        "\"Why should I burden myself with every nameless vagabond that the sea casts up?\" snarled Zaporavo,\n",
        "his look and manner more insulting than his words.\n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "113\n",
        "\"A ship can always use another good sailor,\" answered the other without resentment. Zaporavo scowled,\n",
        "knowing the truth of that assertion. He hesitated, and doing so, lost his ship, his command, his girl, and\n",
        "his life. But of course he could not see into the future, and to him Conan was only another wastrel, cast up,\n",
        "as he put it, by the sea. He did not like the man; yet the fellow had given him no provocation. His manner\n",
        "was not insolent, though rather more confident than Zaporavo liked to see.\n",
        "\"You'll work for your keep,\" snarled the Hawk. \"Get off the poop. And remember, the only law here is my\n",
        "will.\"\n",
        "The smile seemed to broaden on Conan's thin lips. Without hesitation but without haste he turned and\n",
        "descended into the waist. He did not look again at Sancha, who, during the brief conversation, had\n",
        "watched eagerly, all eyes and ears.\n",
        "As he came into the waist the crew thronged about him Zingarans, all of them, half naked, their gaudy\n",
        "silk garments splashed with tar, jewels glinting in ear-rings and dagger-hilts. They were eager for the\n",
        "time-honored sport of baiting the stranger. Here he would be tested, and his future status in the crew\n",
        "decided. Up on the poop Zaporavo had apparently already forgotten the stranger's existence, but Sancha\n",
        "watched, tense with interest. She had become familiar with such scenes, and knew the baiting would be\n",
        "brutal and probably bloody.\n",
        "But her familiarity with such matters was scanty compared to that of Conan. He smiled faintly as he came\n",
        "into the waist and saw the menacing figures pressing truculently about him. He paused and eyed the ring\n",
        "inscrutably, his composure unshaken. There was a certain code about these things. If he had attacked the\n",
        "captain, the whole crew would have been at his throat, but they would give him a fair chance against the\n",
        "one selected to push the brawl.\n",
        "The man chosen for this duty thrust himself forward--a wiry brute, with a crimson sash knotted about his\n",
        "head like a turban. His lean chin jutted out, his scarred face was evil beyond belief. Every glance, each\n",
        "swaggering movement was an affront. His way of beginning the baiting was as primitive, raw and crude\n",
        "as himself.\n",
        "\"Baracha, eh?\" he sneered. \"That's where they raise dogs for men. We of the Fellowship spit on 'em--like\n",
        "this!\"\n",
        "He spat in Conan's face and snatched at his own sword.\n",
        "The Barachan's movement was too quick for the eye to follow. His sledge-like fist crunched with a terrible\n",
        "impact against his tormentor's jaw, and the Zingaran catapulted through the air and fell in a crumpled\n",
        "heap by the rail.\n",
        "Conan turned towards the others. But for a slumbering glitter in his eyes, his bearing was unchanged. But\n",
        "the baiting was over as suddenly as it had begun. The seamen lifted their companion; his broken jaw\n",
        "hung slack, his head lolled unnaturally.\n",
        "\"By Mitra, his neck's broken!\" swore a black-bearded searogue.\n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "114\n",
        "\"You Freebooters are a weak-boned race,\" laughed the pirate. \"On the Barachas we take no account of\n",
        "such taps as that. Will you play at sword-strokes, now, any of you? No? Then all's well, and we're friends,\n",
        "eh?\"\n",
        "There were plenty of tongues to assure him that he spoke truth. Brawny arms swung the dead man over\n",
        "the rail, and a dozen fins cut the water as he sank. Conan laughed and spread his mighty arms as a great\n",
        "cat might stretch itself, and his gaze sought the deck above. Sancha leaned over the rail, red lips parted,\n",
        "dark eyes aglow with interest. The sun behind her outlined her lithe figure through the light kirtle which\n",
        "its glow made transparent. Then across her fell Zaporavo's scowling shadow and a heavy hand fell\n",
        "possessively on her slim shoulder. There were menace and meaning in the glare he bent on the man in the\n",
        "waist; Conan grinned back, as if at a jest none knew but himself.\n",
        "Zaporavo made the mistake so many autocrats make; alone in somber grandeur on the poop, he\n",
        "underestimated the man below him. He had his opportunity to kill Conan, and he let it pass, engrossed in\n",
        "his own gloomy ruminations. He did not find it easy to think any of the dogs beneath his feet constituted\n",
        "a menace to him. He had stood in the high places so long, and had ground so many foes underfoot, that\n",
        "he unconsciously assumed himself to be above the machinations of inferior rivals.\n",
        "Conan, indeed, gave him no provocation. He mixed with the crew, lived and made merry as they did. He\n",
        "proved himself a skilled sailor, and by far the strongest man any of them had seen. He did the work of\n",
        "three men, and was always first to spring to any heavy or dangerous task. His mates began to rely upon\n",
        "him. He did not quarrel with them, and they were careful not to quarrel with him. He gambled with them,\n",
        "putting up his girdle and sheath for a stake, won their money and weapons, and gave them back with a\n",
        "laugh. The crew instinctively looked toward him as the leader of the forecastle. He vouchsafed no\n",
        "information as to what had caused him to flee the Barachas, but the knowledge that he was capable of a\n",
        "deed bloody enough to have exiled him from that wild band increased the respect felt toward him by the\n",
        "fierce Freebooters. Toward Zaporavo and the mates he was imperturbably courteous, never insolent or\n",
        "servile.\n",
        "The dullest was struck by the contrast between the harsh, taciturn, gloomy commander, and the pirate\n",
        "whose laugh was gusty and ready, who roared ribald songs in a dozen languages, guzzled ale like a toper,\n",
        "and--apparently--had no thought for the morrow.\n",
        "Had Zaporavo known he was being compared, even though unconsciously, with a man before the mast,\n",
        "he would have been speechless with amazed anger. But he was engrossed with his broodings, which had\n",
        "become blacker and grimmer as the years crawled by, and with his vague grandiose dreams; and with the\n",
        "girl whose possession was a bitter pleasure, just as all his pleasures were.\n",
        "And she looked more and more at the black-maned giant who towered among his mates at work or play.\n",
        "He never spoke to her, but there was no mistaking the candor of his gaze. She did not mistake it, and she\n",
        "wondered if she dared the perilous game of leading him on.\n",
        "No great length of time lay between her and the palaces of Kordava, but it was as if a world of change\n",
        "separated her from the life she had lived before Zaporavo tore her screaming from the flaming caravel his\n",
        "wolves had plundered. She, who had been the spoiled and petted daughter of the Duke of Kordava,\n",
        "learned what it was to be a buccaneer's plaything, and because she was supple enough to bend without \n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "115\n",
        "breaking, she lived where other women had died, and because she was young and vibrant with life, she\n",
        "came to find pleasure in the existence.\n",
        "The life was uncertain, dream-like, with sharp contrasts of battle, pillage, murder, and flight. Zaporavo's\n",
        "red visions made it even more uncertain than that of the average Freebooter. No one knew what he\n",
        "planned next. Now they had left all charted coasts behind and were plunging further and further into\n",
        "that unknown billowy waste ordinarily shunned by seafarers, and into which, since the beginnings of\n",
        "Time, ships had ventured, only to vanish from the sight of man for ever. All known lands lay behind\n",
        "them, and day upon day the blue surging immensity lay empty to their sight. Here there was no loot--no\n",
        "towns to sack nor ships to burn. The men murmured, though they did not let their murmurings reach the\n",

        "ancient charts and time-yellowed maps, reading in tomes that were crumbling masses of worm-eaten\n",
        "parchment. At times he talked to Sancha, wildly it seemed to her, of lost continents, and fabulous isles\n",
        "dreaming unguessed amidst the blue foam of nameless gulfs, where horned dragons guarded treasures\n",
        "gathered by pre-human kings, long, long ago.\n",
        "Sancha listened, uncomprehending, hugging her slim knees, her thoughts constantly roving away from\n",
        "the words of her grim companion back to a clean-limbed bronze giant whose laughter was gusty and\n",
        "elemental as the sea wind.\n",
        "So, after many weary weeks, they raised land to westward, and at dawn dropped anchor in a shallow bay,\n",
        "and saw a beach which was like a white band bordering an expanse of gently grassy slopes, masked by\n",
        "green trees. The wind brought scents of fresh vegetation and spices, and Sancha clapped her hands with\n",
        "glee at the prospect of adventuring ashore. But her eagerness turned to sulkiness when Zaporavo ordered\n",
        "her to remain aboard until he sent for her. He never gave any explanation for his commands; so she never\n",
        "knew his reason, unless it was the lurking devil in him that frequently made him hurt her without cause.\n",
        "So she lounged sulkily on the poop and watched the men row ashore through the calm water that\n",
        "sparkled like liquid jade in the morning sunlight. She saw them bunch together on the sands, suspicious,\n",
        "weapons ready, while several scattered out through the trees that fringed the beach. Among these, she\n",
        "noted, was Conan. There was no mistaking that tall brown figure with its springy step. Men said he was\n",
        "no civilized man at all, but a Cimmerian, one of those barbaric tribesmen who dwelt in the gray hills of\n",
        "the far North, and whose raids struck terror in their southern neighbors. At least, she knew that there was\n",
        "something about him, some super-vitality or barbarism that set him apart from his wild mates.\n",
        "Voices echoed along the shore, as the silence reassured the buccaneers. The clusters broke up, as men\n",
        "scattered along the beach in search of fruit. She saw them climbing and plucking among the trees, and her\n",
        "pretty mouth watered. She stamped a little foot and swore with a proficiency acquired by association\n",
        "with her blasphemous companions.\n",
        "The men on shore had indeed found fruit, and were gorging on it, finding one unknown golden-skinned\n",
        "variety especially luscious. But Zaporavo did not seek or eat fruit. His scouts having found nothing\n",
        "indicating men or beasts in the neighborhood, he stood staring inland, at the long reaches of grassy slopes\n",
        "melting into one another. Then, with a brief word, he shifted his sword-belt and strode in under the trees.\n",
        "His mate expostulated with him against going alone, and was rewarded by a savage blow in the mouth.\n",
        "Zaporavo had his reasons for wishing to go alone. He desired to learn if this island were indeed that\n",
        "mentioned in the mysterious Book of Skelos, whereon, nameless sages aver, strange monsters guard \n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "116\n",
        "crypts filled with hieroglyph-careen gold. Nor, for murky reasons of his own, did he wish to share his\n",
        "knowledge, if it were true, with any one, much less his own crew.\n",
        "Sancha, watching eagerly from the poop, saw him vanish into the leafy fastness. Presently she saw Conan,\n",
        "the Barachan, turn, glance briefly at the men scattered up and down the beach; then the pirate went\n",
        "quickly in the direction taken by Zaporavo, and likewise vanished among the trees.\n",
        "Sancha's curiosity was piqued. She waited for them to reappear, but they did not. The seamen still moved\n",
        "aimlessly up and down the beach, and some had wandered inland. Many had lain down in the shade to\n",
        "sleep. Time passed and she fidgeted about restlessly. The sun began to beat down hotly, in spite of the\n",

        "a band of blue shallow water, the cool shady mystery of tree-fringed beach and woodland-dotted\n",

        "She well knew the penalty for disobeying her merciless master, and she sat for some time, squirming with\n",
        "indecision. At last she decided that it was worth even one of Zaporavo's whippings to play truant, and\n",
        "with no more ado she kicked off her soft leather sandals, slipped out of her kirtle and stood up on the\n",
        "deck naked as Eve. Clambering over the rail and down the chains, she slid into the water and swam\n",
        "ashore. She stood on the beach a few moments, squirming as the sands tickled her small toes, while she\n",
        "looked for the crew. She saw only a few, at some distance up or down the beach. Many were fast asleep\n",
        "under the trees, bits of golden fruit still clutched in their fingers. She wondered why they should sleep so\n",
        "soundly, so early in the day.\n",
        "None hailed her as she crossed the white girdle of sand and entered the shade of the woodland. The trees,\n",
        "she found, grew in irregular clusters, and between these groves stretched rolling expanses of meadowlike slopes. As she progressed inland, in the direction taken by Zaporavo, she was entranced by the green\n",
        "vistas that unfolded gently before her, soft slope beyond slope, carpeted with green sward and dotted\n",
        "with groves. Between the slopes lay gentle declivities, likewise swarded. The scenery seemed to melt into\n",
        "itself, or each scene into the other; the view was singular, at once broad and restricted. Over all a dreamy\n",
        "silence lay like an enchantment.\n",
        "Then she came suddenly onto the level summit of a slope, circled with tall trees, and the dreamily faerylike sensation vanished abruptly at the sight of what lay on the reddened and trampled grass. Sancha\n",
        "involuntarily cried out and recoiled, then stole forward, wide-eyed, trembling in every limb.\n",
        "It was Zaporavo who lay there on the sward, staring sightlessly upward, a gaping wound in his breast.\n",
        "His sword lay near his nerveless hand. The Hawk had made his last swoop.\n",
        "It is not to be said that Sancha gazed on the corpse of her lord without emotion. She had no cause to love\n",
        "him, yet she felt at least the sensation any girl might feel when looking on the body of the man who was\n",
        "first to possess her. She did not weep or feel any need of weeping, but she was seized by a strong\n",
        "trembling, her blood seemed to congeal briefly, and she resisted a wave of hysteria.\n",
        "She looked about her for the man she expected to see. Nothing met her eyes but the ring of tall, thickly\n",
        "leafed forest giants, and the blue slopes beyond them. Had the Freebooter's slayer dragged himself away,\n",
        "mortally wounded? No bloody tracks led away from the body.\n",

        "117\n",
        "Puzzled, she swept the surrounding trees, stiffening as she caught a rustle in the emerald leaves that\n",
        "seemed not to be of the wind. She went toward the trees, staring into the leafy depths.\n",
        "\"Conan?\" Her call was inquiring; her voice sounded strange and small in the vastness of silence that had\n",
        "grown suddenly tense.\n",
        "Her knees began to tremble as a nameless panic swept over her.\n",
        "\"Conan!\" she cried desperately. \"It is I--Sancha! Where are you? Please, Conan--\" Her voice faltered away.\n",
        "Unbelieving horror dilated her brown eyes. Her red lips parted to an inarticulate scream. Paralysis\n",
        "gripped her limbs; where she had such desperate need of swift flight, she could not move. She could only\n",

        "\n",
        "When Conan saw Zaporavo stalk alone into the woodland, he felt that the chance he had watched for had\n",
        "come. He had eaten no fruit, nor joined in the horse-play of his mates; all his faculties were occupied with\n",
        "watching the buccaneer chief. Accustomed to Zaporavo's moods, his men were not particularly surprized\n",
        "that their captain should choose to explore an unknown and probably hostile isle alone. They turned to\n",
        "their own amusement, and did not notice Conan when he glided like a stalking panther after the chieftain.\n",
        "Conan did not underrate his dominance of the crew. But he had not gained the right, through battle and\n",
        "foray, to challenge the captain to a duel to the death. In these empty seas there had been no opportunity\n",
        "for him to prove himself according to Freebooter law. The crew would stand solidly against him if he\n",
        "attacked the chieftain openly. But he knew that if he killed Zaporavo without their knowledge, the\n",
        "leaderless crew would not be likely to be swayed by loyalty to a dead man. In such wolf-packs only the\n",
        "living counted.\n",
        "So he followed Zaporavo with sword in hand and eagerness in his heart, until he came out onto a level\n",
        "summit, circled with tall trees, between whose trunks he saw the green vistas of the slopes melting into\n",
        "the blue distance. In the midst of the glade Zaporavo, sensing pursuit, turned, hand on hilt.\n",
        "The buccaneer swore.\n",
        "\"Dog, why do you follow me?\"\n",
        "\"Are you mad, to ask?\" laughed Conan, coming swiftly toward his erstwhile chief. His lips smiled, and in\n",
        "his blue eyes danced a wild gleam.\n",
        "Zaporavo ripped out his sword with a black curse, and steel clashed against steel as the Barachan came in\n",
        "recklessly and wide open, his blade singing a wheel of blue flame about his head.\n",
        "Zaporavo was the veteran of a thousand fights by sea and by land. There was no man in the world more\n",
        "deeply and thoroughly versed than he in the lore of swordcraft. But he had never been pitted against a\n",
        "blade wielded by thews bred in the wild lands beyond the borders of civilization. Against his fighting-\n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "118\n",
        "craft was matched blinding speed and strength impossible to a civilized man. Conan's manner of fighting\n",
        "was unorthodox, but instinctive and natural as that of a timber wolf. The intricacies of the sword were as\n",
        "useless against his primitive fury as a human boxer's skill against the onslaughts of a panther.\n",
        "Fighting as he had never fought before, straining every last ounce of effort to parry the blade that\n",
        "flickered like lightning about his head, Zaporavo in desperation caught a full stroke near his hilt, and felt\n",
        "his whole arm go numb beneath the terrific impact. That stroke was instantly followed by a thrust with\n",
        "such terrible drive behind it that the sharp point ripped through chain-mail and ribs like paper, to\n",
        "transfix the heart beneath. Zaporavo's lips writhed in brief agony, but, grim to the last, he made no sound.\n",
        "He was dead before his body relaxed on the trampled grass, where blood drops glittered like spilt rubies\n",
        "in the sun.\n",
        "Conan shook the red drops from his sword, grinned with unaffected pleasure, stretched like a huge cat--\n",
        "and abruptly stiffened, the expression of satisfaction on his face being replaced by a stare of\n",
        "bewilderment. He stood like a statue, his sword trailing in his hand.\n",
        "As he lifted his eyes from his vanquished foe, they had absently rested on the surrounding trees, and the\n",
        "vistas beyond. And he had seen a fantastic thing--a thing incredible and inexplicable. Over the soft\n",
        "rounded green shoulder of a distant slope had loped a tall black naked figure, bearing on its shoulder an\n",
        "equally naked white form. The apparition vanished as suddenly as it had appeared, leaving the watcher\n",
        "gasping in surprize.\n",
        "The pirate stared about him, glanced uncertainly back the way he had come, and swore. He was\n",
        "nonplussed--a bit upset, if the term might be applied to one of such steely nerves as his. In the midst of\n",
        "realistic, if exotic surroundings, a vagrant image of fantasy and nightmare had been introduced. Conan\n",
        "doubted neither his eyesight nor his sanity. He had seen something alien and uncanny, he knew; the\n",
        "mere fact of a black figure racing across the landscape carrying a white captive was bizarre enough, but\n",
        "this black figure had been unnaturally tall.\n",
        "Shaking his head doubtfully, Conan started off in the direction in which he had seen the thing. He did not\n",
        "argue the wisdom of his move; with his curiosity so piqued, he had no choice but to follow its\n",
        "promptings.\n",
        "Slope after slope he traversed, each with its even sward and clustered groves. The general trend was\n",
        "always upward, though he ascended and descended the gentle inclines with monotonous regularity. The\n",
        "array of rounded shoulders and shallow declivities was bewildering and apparently endless. But at last\n",
        "he advanced up what he believed was the highest summit on the island, and halted at the sight of green\n",
        "shining walls and towers, which, until he had reached the spot on which he then stood, had merged so\n",
        "perfectly with the green landscape as to be invisible, even to his keen sight.\n",
        "He hesitated, fingered his sword, then went forward, bitten by the worm of curiosity. He saw no one as\n",
        "he approached a tall archway in the curving wall. There was no door. Peering warily through, he saw\n",
        "what seemed to be a broad open court, grass-carpeted, surrounded by a circular wall of the green\n",
        "semitranslucent substance. Various arches opened from it. Advancing on the balls of his bare feet, sword\n",
        "ready, he chose one of these arches at random, and passed into another similar court. Over an inner wall\n",
        "he saw the pinnacles of strangely shaped towerlike structures. One of these towers was built in, or \n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "119\n",
        "projected into the court in which he found himself, and a broad stair led up to it, along the side of the\n",
        "wall. Up this he went, wondering if it were all real, or if he were not in the midst of a black lotus dream.\n",
        "At the head of the stair he found himself on a walled ledge, or balcony, he was not sure which. He could\n",
        "now make out more details of the towers, but they were meaningless to him. He realized uneasily that no\n",
        "ordinary human beings could have built them. There was symmetry about their architecture, and system,\n",
        "but it was a mad symmetry, a system alien to human sanity. As for the plan of the whole town, castle, or\n",
        "whatever it was intended for, he could see just enough to get the impression of a great number of courts,\n",
        "mostly circular, each surrounded by its own wall, and connected with the others by open arches, and all,\n",
        "apparently, grouped about the cluster of fantastic towers in the center.\n",
        "Turning in the other direction from these towers, he got a fearful shock, and crouched down suddenly\n",
        "behind the parapet of the balcony, glaring amazedly.\n",
        "The balcony or ledge was higher than the opposite wall, and he was looking over that wall into another\n",
        "swarded court. The inner curve of the further wall of that court differed from the others he had seen, in\n",
        "that, instead of being smooth, it seemed to be banded with long lines or ledges, crowded with small\n",
        "objects the nature of which he could not determine.\n",
        "However, he gave little heed to the wall at the time. His attention was centered on the band of beings that\n",
        "squatted about a dark green pool in the midst of the court. These creatures were black and naked, made\n",
        "like men, but the least of them, standing upright, would have towered head and shoulders above the tall\n",
        "pirate. They were rangy rather than massive, but were finely formed, with no suggestion of deformity or\n",
        "abnomality, save as their great height was abnormal. But even at that distance Conan sensed the basic\n",
        "diabolism of their features.\n",
        "In their midst, cringing and naked, stood a youth that Conan recognized as the youngest sailor aboard\n",
        "the Wastrel. He, then, had been the captive the pirate had seen borne across the grass-covered slope.\n",
        "Conan had heard no sound of fighting--saw no blood-stains or wounds on the sleek ebon limbs of the\n",
        "giants. Evidently the lad had wandered inland away from his companions and been snatched up by a\n",
        "black man lurking in ambush. Conan mentally termed the creatures black men, for lack of a better term;\n",
        "instinctively he knew that these tall ebony beings were not men, as he understood the term.\n",
        "No sound came to him. The blacks nodded and gestured to one another, but they did not seem to speak--\n",
        "vocally, at least. One, squatting on his haunches before the cringing boy, held a pipe-like thing in his\n",
        "hand. This he set to his lips, and apparently blew, though Conan heard no sound. But the Zingaran youth\n",
        "heard or felt, and cringed. He quivered and writhed as if in agony; a regularity became evident in the\n",
        "twitching of his limbs, which quickly became rhythmic. The twitching became a violent jerking, the\n",
        "jerking regular movements. The youth began to dance, as cobras dance by compulsion to the tune of the\n",
        "faquir's fife. There was naught of zest or joyful abandon in that dance. There was, indeed, abandon that\n",
        "was awful to see, but it was not joyful. It was as if the mute tune of the pipes grasped the boy's inmost\n",
        "soul with salacious fingers and with brutal torture wrung from it every involuntary expression of secret\n",
        "passion. It was a convulsion of obscenity, a spasm of lasciviousness--an exudation of secret hungers\n",
        "framed by compulsion: desire without pleasure, pain mated awfully to lust. It was like watching a soul\n",
        "stripped naked, and all its dark and unmentionable secrets laid bare.\n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "120\n",
        "Conan glared frozen with repulsion and shaken with nausea. Himself as cleanly elemental as a timber\n",
        "wolf, he was yet not ignorant of the perverse secrets of rotting civilizations. He had roamed the cities of\n",
        "Zamora, and known the women of Shadizar the Wicked. But he sensed here a cosmic vileness\n",
        "transcending mere human degeneracy--a perverse branch on the tree of Life, developed along lines\n",
        "outside human comprehension. It was not at the agonized contortions and posturing of the wretched boy\n",
        "that he was shocked, but at the cosmic obscenity of these beings which could drag to light the abysmal\n",
        "secrets that sleep in the unfathomed darkness of the human soul, and find pleasure in the brazen\n",
        "flaunting of such things as should not be hinted at, even in restless nightmares.\n",
        "Suddenly the black torturer laid down the pipes and rose, towering over the writhing white figure.\n",
        "Brutally grasping the boy by neck and haunch, the giant up-ended him and thrust him head-first into the\n",
        "green pool. Conan saw the white glimmer of his naked body amid the green water, as the black giant\n",
        "held his captive deep under the surface. Then there was a restless movement among the other blacks, and\n",
        "Conan ducked quickly below the balcony wall, not daring to raise his head lest he be seen.\n",
        "After a while his curiosity got the better of him, and he cautiously peered out again. The blacks were\n",
        "filing out of an archway into another court. One of them was just placing something on a ledge of the\n",
        "further wall, and Conan saw it was the one who had tortured the boy. He was taller than the others, and\n",
        "wore a jeweled head-band. Of the Zingaran boy there was no trace. The giant followed his fellows, and\n",
        "presently Conan saw them emerge from the archway by which he had gained access to that castle of\n",
        "horror, and file away across the green slopes, in the direction from which he had come. They bore no\n",
        "arms, yet he felt that they planned further aggression against the Freebooters.\n",
        "But before he went to warn the unsuspecting buccaneers, he wished to investigate the fate of the boy. No\n",
        "sound disturbed the quiet. The pirate believed that the towers and courts were deserted save for himself.\n",
        "He went swiftly down the stair, crossed the court and passed through an arch into the court the blacks\n",
        "had just quitted. Now he saw the nature of the striated wall. It was banded by narrow ledges, apparently\n",
        "cut out of the solid stone, and ranged along these ledges or shelves were thousands of tiny figures, mostly\n",
        "grayish in color. These figures, not much longer than a man's hand, represented men, and so cleverly\n",
        "were they made that Conan recognized various racial characteristics in the different idols, features typical\n",
        "of Zingarans, Argoseans, Ophireans and Kushite corsairs. These last were black in color, just as their\n",
        "models were black in reality. Conan was aware of a vague uneasiness as he stared at the dumb sightless\n",
        "figures. There was a mimicry of reality about them that was somehow disturbing. He felt of them\n",
        "gingerly and could not decide of what material they were made. It felt like petrified bone; but he could\n",
        "not imagine petrified substance being found in the locality in such abundance as to be used so lavishly.\n",
        "He noticed that the images representing types with which he was familiar were all on the higher ledges.\n",
        "The lower ledges were occupied by figures the features of which were strange to him. They either\n",
        "embodied merely the artists' imagination, or typified racial types long vanished and forgotten.\n",
        "Shaking his head impatiently, Conan turned toward the pool. The circular court offered no place of\n",
        "concealment; as the body of the boy was nowhere in sight, it must be lying at the bottom of the pool.\n",
        "Approaching the placid green disk, he stared into the glimmering surface. It was like looking through a\n",
        "thick green glass, unclouded, yet strangely illusory. Of no great dimensions, the pool was round as a well,\n",
        "bordered by a rim of green jade. Looking down he could see the rounded bottom--how far below the \n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "121\n",
        "surface he could not decide. But the pool seemed incredibly deep--he was aware of a dizziness as he\n",
        "looked down, much as if he were looking into an abyss. He was puzzled by his ability to see the bottom;\n",
        "but it lay beneath his gaze, impossibly remote, illusive, shadowy, yet visible. At times he thought a faint\n",
        "luminosity was apparent deep in the jade-colored depth, but he could not be sure. Yet he was sure that\n",
        "the pool was empty except for the shimmering water.\n",
        "Then where in the name of Crom was the boy whom he had seen brutally drowned in that pool? Rising,\n",
        "Conan fingered his sword, and gazed around the court again. His gaze focused on a spot on one of the\n",
        "higher ledges. There he had seen the tall black place something--cold sweat broke suddenly out on\n",
        "Conan's brown hide.\n",
        "Hesitantly, yet as if drawn by a magnet, the pirate approached the shimmering wall. Dazed by a\n",
        "suspicion too monstrous to voice, he glared up at the last figure on that ledge. A horrible familiarity made\n",
        "itself evident. Stony, immobile, dwarfish, yet unmistakable, the features of the Zingaran boy stared\n",
        "unseeingly at him. Conan recoiled, shaken to his soul's foundations. His sword trailed in his paralyzed\n",
        "hand as he glared, open-mouthed, stunned by the realization which was too abysmal and awful for the\n",
        "mind to grasp.\n",
        "Yet the fact was indisputable; the secret of the dwarfish figures was revealed, though behind that secret\n",
        "lay the darker and more cryptic secret of their being.\n",
        "III\n",
        "How long Conan stood drowned in dizzy cogitation, he never knew. A voice shook him out of his gaze, a\n",
        "feminine voice that shrieked more and more loudly, as if the owner of the voice were being borne nearer.\n",
        "Conan recognized that voice, and his paralysis vanished instantly.\n",
        "A quick bound carried him high up on the narrow ledges, where he clung, kicking aside the clustering\n",
        "images to obtain room for his feet. Another spring and a scramble, and he was clinging to the rim of the\n",
        "wall, glaring over it. It was an outer wall; he was looking into the green meadow that surrounded the\n",
        "castle.\n",
        "Across the grassy level a giant black was striding, carrying a squirming captive under one arm as a man\n",
        "might carry a rebellious child. It was Sancha, her black hair falling in disheveled rippling waves, her olive\n",
        "skin contrasting abruptly with the glossy ebony of her captor. He gave no heed to her wrigglings and\n",
        "cries as he made for the outer archway.\n",
        "As he vanished within, Conan sprang recklessly down the wall and glided into the arch that opened into\n",
        "the further court. Crouching there, he saw the giant enter the court of the pool, carrying his writhing\n",
        "captive. Now he was able to make out the creature's details.\n",
        "The superb symmetry of body and limbs was more impressive at close range. Under the ebon skin long,\n",
        "rounded muscles rippled, and Conan did not doubt that the monster could rend an ordinary man limb\n",
        "from limb. The nails of the fingers provided further weapons, for they were grown like the talons of a\n",
        "wild beast. The face was a carven ebony mask. The eyes' were tawny, a vibrant gold that glowed and\n",
        "glittered. But the face was inhuman; each line, each feature was stamped with evil--evil transcending the\n",
        "mere evil of humanity. The thing was not a human--it could not be; it was a growth of Life from the pits\n",
        "of blasphemous creation--a perversion of evolutionary development.\n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "122\n",
        "The giant cast Sancha down on the sward, where she grovelled, crying with pain and terror. He cast a\n",
        "glance about as if uncertain, and his tawny eyes narrowed as they rested on the images overturned and\n",
        "knocked from the wall. Then he stooped, grasped his captive by her neck and crotch, and strode\n",
        "purposefully toward the green pool. And Conan glided from his archway, and raced like a wind of death\n",
        "across the sward.\n",
        "The giant wheeled, and his eyes flared as he saw the bronzed avenger rushing toward him. In the instant\n",
        "of surprize his cruel grip relaxed and Sancha wriggled from his hands and fell to the grass. The taloned\n",
        "hands spread and clutched, but Conan ducked beneath their swoop and drove his sword through the\n",
        "giant's groin. The black went down like a felled tree, gushing blood, and the next instant Conan was\n",
        "seized in a frantic grasp as Sancha sprang up and threw her arms around him in a frenzy of terror and\n",
        "hysterical relief.\n",
        "He cursed as he disengaged himself, but his foe was already dead; the tawny eyes were glazed, the long\n",
        "ebony limbs had ceased to twitch.\n",
        "\"Oh, Conan,\" Sancha was sobbing, clinging tenaciously to him, \"what will become of us? What are these\n",
        "monsters? Oh, surely this is hell and that was the devil-\"\n",
        "\"Then hell needs a new devil.\" The Barachan grinned fiercely. \"But how did he get hold of you? Have\n",
        "they taken the ship?\"\n",
        "\"I don't know.\" She tried to wipe away her tears, fumbled for her skirt, and then remembered that she\n",
        "wore none. \"I came ashore. I saw you follow Zaporavo, and I followed you both. I found Zaporavo--was--\n",
        "was it you who-\"\n",
        "\"Who else?\" he grunted. \"What then?\"\n",
        "\"I saw a movement in the trees,\" she shuddered. \"I thought it was you. I called--then I saw that--that black\n",
        "thing squatting like an ape among the branches, leering down at me. It was like a nightmare; I couldn't\n",
        "run. All I could do was squeal. Then it dropped from the tree and seized me--oh, oh, oh!\" She hid her face\n",
        "in her hands, and was shaken anew at the memory of the horror.\n",
        "\"Well, we've got to get out of here,\" he growled, catching her wrist. \"Come on; we've got to get to the\n",
        "crew-\"\n",
        "\"Most of them were asleep on the beach as I entered the woods,\" she said.\n",
        "\"Asleep?\" he exclaimed profanely. \"What in the seven devils of hell's fire and damnation-\"\n",
        "\"Listen!\" She froze, a white quivering image of fright.\n",
        "\"I heard it!\" he snapped. \"A moaning cry! Wait!\"\n",
        "He bounded up the ledges again and, glaring over the wall, swore with a concentrated fury that made\n",
        "even Sancha gasp. The black men were returning, but they came not alone or empty-handed. Each bore a\n",
        "limp human form; some bore two. Their captives were the Freebooters; they hung slackly in their captors'\n",
        "arms, and but for an occasional vague movement or twitching, Conan would have believed them dead.\n",
        "They had been disarmed but not stripped; one of the blacks bore their sheathed swords, a great armload \n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "123\n",
        "of bristling steel. From time to time one of the seamen voiced a vague cry, like a drunkard calling out in\n",
        "sottish sleep.\n",
        "Like a trapped wolf Conan glared about him. Three arches led out of the court of the pool. Through the\n",
        "eastern arch the blacks had left the court, and through it they would presumably return. He had entered\n",
        "by the southern arch. In the western arch he had hidden, and had not had time to notice what lay beyond\n",
        "it. Regardless of his ignorance of the plan of the castle, he was forced to make his decision promptly.\n",
        "Springing down the wall, he replaced the images with frantic haste, dragged the corpse of his victim to\n",
        "the pool and cast it in. It sank instantly and, as he looked, he distinctly saw an appalling contraction--a\n",
        "shrinking, a hardening. He hastily turned away, shuddering. Then he seized his companion's arm and led\n",
        "her hastily toward the southern archway, while she begged to be told what was happening.\n",
        "\"They've bagged the crew,\" he answered hastily. \"I haven't any plan, but we'll hide somewhere and watch.\n",
        "If they don't look in the pool, they may not suspect our presence.\"\n",
        "\"But they'll see the blood on the grass!\"\n",
        "\"Maybe they'll think one of their own devils spilled it,\" he answered. \"Anyway, we'll have to take the\n",
        "chance.\"\n",
        "They were in the court from which he had watched the torture of the boy, and he led her hastily up the\n",
        "stair that mounted the southern wall, and forced her into a crouching position behind the balustrade of\n",
        "the balcony; it was poor concealment, but the best they could do.\n",
        "Scarcely had they settled themselves, when the blacks filed into the court. There was a resounding clash\n",
        "at the foot of the stairs, and Conan stiffened, grasping his sword. But the blacks passed through an\n",
        "archway on the southwestern side, and they heard a series of thuds and groans. The giants were casting\n",
        "their victims down on the sward. An hysterical giggle rose to Sancha's lips, and Conan quickly clapped\n",
        "his hand over her mouth, stifling the sound before it could betray them.\n",
        "After a while they heard the padding of many feet on the sward below, and then silence reigned. Conan\n",
        "peered over the wall. The court was empty. The blacks were once more gathered about the pool in the\n",
        "adjoining court, squatting on their haunches. They seemed to pay no heed to the great smears of blood on\n",
        "the sward and the jade rim of the pool. Evidently blood stains were nothing unusual. Nor were they\n",
        "looking into the pool. They were engrossed in scone inexplicable conclave of their own; the tall black was\n",
        "playing again on his golden pipes, and his companions listened like ebony statues.\n",
        "Taking Sancha's hand, Conan glided down the stair, stooping so that his head would not be visible above\n",
        "the wall. The cringing girl followed perforce, staring fearfully at the arch that let into the court of the pool,\n",
        "but through which, at that angle, neither the pool nor its grim throng were visible. At the foot of the stair\n",
        "lay the swords of the Zingarans. The clash they had heard had been the casting down of the captured\n",
        "weapons.\n",
        "Conan drew Sancha toward the southwestern arch, and they silently crossed the sward and entered the\n",
        "court beyond. There the Freebooters lay in careless heaps, mustaches bristling, earrings glinting. Here\n",
        "and there one stirred or groaned restlessly. Conan bent down to them, and Sancha knelt beside him,\n",
        "leaning forward with her hands on her thighs.\n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "124\n",
        "\"What is that sweet cloying smell?\" she asked nervously. \"It's on all their breaths.\"\n",
        "\"It's that damned fruit they were eating,\" he answered softly. \"I remember the smell of it. It must have\n",
        "been like the black lotus, that makes men sleep. By Crom, they are beginning to awake--but they're\n",
        "unarmed, and I have an idea that those black devils won't wait long before they begin their magic on\n",
        "them. What chance will the lads have, unarmed and stupid with slumber?\"\n",
        "He brooded for an instant, scowling with the intentness of his thoughts; then seized Sancha's olive\n",
        "shoulder in a grip that made her wince.\n",
        "\"Listen! I'll draw those black swine into another part of the castle and keep them busy for a while.\n",
        "Meanwhile you shake these fools awake, and bring their swords to them--it's a fighting chance. Can you\n",
        "do it?\"\n",
        "\"I--I--don't know!\" she stammered, shaking with terror, and hardly knowing what she was saying.\n",
        "With a curse, Conan caught her thick tresses near her head and shook her until the walls danced to her\n",
        "dizzy sight.\n",
        "\"You must do it!\" he hissed at her. \"It's our only chance!\"\n",
        "\"I'll do my best!\" she gasped, and with a grunt of commendation and an encouraging slap on the back\n",
        "that nearly knocked her down, he glided away.\n",
        "A few moments later he was crouching at the arch that opened into the court of the pool, glaring upon his\n",
        "enemies. They still sat about the pool, but were beginning to show evidences of an evil impatience. From\n",
        "the court where lay the rousing buccaneers he heard their groans growing louder, beginning to be\n",
        "mingled with incoherent curses. He tensed his muscles and sank into a pantherish crouch, breathing\n",
        "easily between his teeth.\n",
        "The jeweled giant rose, taking his pipes from his lips--and at that instant Conan was among the startled\n",
        "blacks with a tigerish bound. And as a tiger leaps and strikes among his prey, Conan leaped and struck:\n",
        "thrice his blade flickered before any could lift a hand in defense; then he bounded from among them and\n",
        "raced across the sward. Behind him sprawled three black figures, their skulls split.\n",
        "But though the unexpected fury of his surprize had caught the giants off guard, the survivors recovered\n",
        "quickly enough. They were at his heels as he ran through the western arch, their long legs sweeping them\n",
        "over the ground at headlong speed. However, he felt confident of his ability to outfoot them at will; but\n",
        "that was not his purpose. He intended leading them on a long chase, in order to give Sancha time to rouse\n",
        "and arm the Zingarans.\n",
        "And as he raced into the court beyond the western arch, he swore. This court differed from the others he\n",
        "had seen. Instead of being round, it was octagonal, and the arch by which he had entered was the only\n",
        "entrance or exit.\n",
        "Wheeling, he saw that the entire band had followed him in; a group clustered in the arch, and the rest\n",
        "spread out in a wide line as they approached. He faced them, backing slowly toward the northern wall.\n",
        "The line bent into a semicircle, spreading out to hem him in. He continued to move backward, but more \n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "125\n",
        "and more slowly, noting the spaces widening between the pursuers. They feared lest he should try to dart\n",
        "around a horn of the crescent, and lengthened their line to prevent it.\n",
        "He watched with the calm alertness of a wolf, and when he struck it was with the devastating\n",
        "suddenness of a thunderbolt--full at the center of the crescent. The giant who barred his way went down\n",
        "cloven to the middle of the breast-bone, and the pirate was outside their closing ring before the blacks to\n",
        "right and left could come to their stricken comrade's aid. The group at the gate prepared to receive his\n",
        "onslaught, but Conan did not charge them. He had turned and was watching his hunters without\n",
        "apparent emotion, and certainly without fear.\n",
        "This time they did not spread out in a thin line. They had learned that it was fatal to divide their forces\n",
        "against such an incarnation of clawing, rending fury. They bunched up in a compact mass, and advanced\n",
        "on him without undue haste, maintaining their formation.\n",
        "Conan knew that if he fell foul of that mass of taloned muscle and bone, there could be but one\n",
        "culmination. Once let them drag him down among them where they could reach him with their talons\n",
        "and use their greater body-weight to advantage, even his primitive ferocity would not prevail. He\n",
        "glanced around the wall and saw a ledge-like projection above a corner on the western side. What it was\n",
        "he did not know, but it would serve his purpose. He began backing toward that corner, and the giants\n",
        "advanced more rapidly. They evidently thought that they were herding him into the corner themselves,\n",
        "and Conan found time to reflect that they probably looked on him as a member of a lower order,\n",
        "mentally inferior to themselves. So much the better. Nothing is more disastrous than underestimating\n",
        "one's antagonist.\n",
        "Now he was only a few yards from the wall, and the blacks were closing in rapidly, evidently thinking to\n",
        "pin him in the corner before he realized his situation. The group at the gate had deserted their post and\n",
        "were hastening to join their fellows. The giants half-crouched, eyes blazing like golden hell-fire, teeth\n",
        "glistening whitely, taloned hands lifted as if to fend off attack. They expected an abrupt and violent move\n",
        "on the part of their prey, but when it came, it took them by surprize.\n",
        "Conan lifted his sword, took a step toward them, then wheeled and raced to the wall. With a fleeting coil\n",
        "and release of steel muscles, he shot high in the air, and his straining arm hooked its fingers over the\n",
        "projection. Instantly there was a rending crash and the jutting ledge gave way, precipitating the pirate\n",
        "back into the court.\n",
        "He hit on his back, which for all its springy sinews would have broken but for the cushioning of the\n",
        "sward, and rebounding like a great cat, he faced his foes. The dancing recklessness was gone from his\n",
        "eyes. They blazed like blue bale-fire; his mane bristled, his thin lips snarled. In an instant the affair had\n",
        "changed from a daring game to a battle of life and death, and Conan's savage nature responded with all\n",
        "the fury of the wild.\n",
        "The blacks, halted an instant by the swiftness of the episode, now made to sweep on him and drag him\n",
        "down. But in that instant a shout broke the stillness. Wheeling, the giants saw a disreputable throng\n",
        "crowding the arch. The buccaneers weaved drunkenly, they swore incoherently; they were addled and\n",
        "bewildered, but they grasped their swords and advanced with a ferocity not dimmed in the slightest by\n",
        "the fact that they did not understand what it was all about.\n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "126\n",
        "As the blacks glared in amazement, Conan yelled stridently and struck them like a razor-edged\n",
        "thunderbolt. They fell like ripe grains beneath his blade, and the Zingarans, shouting with muddled fury,\n",
        "ran groggily across the court and fell on their gigantic foes with bloodthirsty zeal. They were still dazed;\n",
        "emerging hazily from drugged slumber, they had felt Sancha frantically shaking them and shoving\n",
        "swords into their fists, and had vaguely heard her urging them to some sort of action. They had not\n",
        "understood all she said, but the sight of strangers, and blood streaming, was enough for them.\n",
        "In an instant the court was turned into a battle-ground which soon resembled a slaughter-house. The\n",
        "Zingarans weaved and rocked on their feet, but they wielded their swords with power and effect,\n",
        "swearing prodigiously, and quite oblivious to all wounds except those instantly fatal. They far\n",
        "outnumbered the blacks, but these proved themselves no mean antagonists. Towering above their\n",
        "assailants, the giants wrought havoc with talons and teeth, tearing out men's throats, and dealing blows\n",
        "with clenched fists that crushed in skulls. Mixed and mingled in that melee, the buccaneers could not use\n",
        "their superior agility to the best advantage, and many were too stupid from their drugged sleep to avoid\n",
        "blows aimed at them. They fought with a blind wild-beast ferocity, too intent on dealing death to evade it.\n",
        "The sound of the hacking swords was like that of butchers' cleavers, and the shrieks, yells and curses\n",
        "were appalling.\n",
        "Sancha, shrinking in the archway, was stunned by the noise and fury; she got a dazed impression of a\n",
        "whirling chaos in which steel flashed and hacked, arms tossed, snarling faces appeared and vanished,\n",
        "and straining bodies collided, rebounded, locked and mingled in a devil's dance of madness.\n",
        "Details stood out briefly, like black etchings on a background of blood. She saw a Zingaran sailor, blinded\n",
        "by a great flap of scalp torn loose and hanging over his eyes, brace his straddling legs and drive his\n",
        "sword to the hilt in a black belly. She distinctly heard the buccaneer grunt as he struck, and saw the\n",
        "victim's tawny eyes roll up in sudden agony; blood and entrails gushed out over the driven blade. The\n",
        "dying black caught the blade with his naked hands, and the sailor tugged blindly and stupidly; then a\n",
        "black arm hooked about the Zingaran's head, a black knee was planted with cruel force in the middle of\n",
        "his back. His head was jerked back at a terrible angle, and something cracked above the noise of the fray,\n",
        "like the breaking of a thick branch. The conqueror dashed his victim's body to the earth--and as he did,\n",
        "something like a beam of blue light flashed across his shoulders from behind, from right to left. He\n",
        "staggered, his head toppled forward on his breast, and thence, hideously, to the earth.\n",
        "Sancha turned sick. She gagged and wished to vomit. She made abortive efforts to turn and flee from the\n",
        "spectacle, but her legs would not work. Nor could she close her eyes. In fact, she opened them wider.\n",
        "Revolted, repelled, nauseated, yet she felt the awful fascination she had always experienced at sight of\n",
        "blood. Yet this battle transcended anything she had ever seen fought out between human beings in port\n",
        "raids or sea battles. Then she saw Conan.\n",
        "Separated from his mates by the whole mass of the enemy, Conan had been enveloped in a black wave of\n",
        "arms and bodies, and dragged down. Then they would quickly have stamped the life out of him, but he\n",
        "had pulled down one of them with him, and the black's body protected that of the pirate beneath him.\n",
        "They kicked and tore at the Barachan and dragged at their writhing comrade, but Conan's teeth were set\n",
        "desperately in his throat, and the pirate clung tenaciously to his dying shield.\n",
        "An onslaught of Zingarans caused a slackening of the press, and Conan threw aside the corpse and rose,\n",
        "blood-smeared and terrible. The giants towered above him like great black shadows, clutching, buffeting \n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "127\n",
        "the air with terrible blows. But he was as hard to hit or grapple as a blood-mad panther, and at every turn\n",
        "or flash of his blade, blood jetted. He had already taken punishment enough to kill three ordinary men,\n",
        "but his bull-like vitality was undiminished.\n",
        "His war cry rose above the medley of the carnage, and the bewildered but furious Zingarans took fresh\n",
        "heart and redoubled their strokes, until the rending of flesh and the crunching of bone beneath the\n",
        "swords almost drowned the howls of pain and wrath.\n",
        "The blacks wavered, and broke for the gate, and Sancha squealed at their coming and scurried out of the\n",
        "way. They jammed in the narrow archway, and the Zingarans stabbed and hacked at their straining backs\n",
        "with strident yelps of glee. The gate was a shambles before the survivors broke through and scattered,\n",
        "each for himself.\n",
        "The battle became a chase. Across grassy courts, up shimmering stairs, over the slanting roofs of fantastic\n",
        "towers, even along the broad coping of the walls, the giants fled, dripping blood at each step, harried by\n",
        "their merciless pursuers as by wolves. Cornered, some of them turned at bay and men died. But the\n",
        "ultimate result was always the same--a mangled black body twitching on the sward, or hurled writhing\n",
        "and twisting from parapet or tower roof.\n",
        "Sancha had taken refuge in the court of the pool, where she crouched, shaking with terror. Outside rose a\n",
        "fierce yelling, feet pounded the sward, and through the arch burst a black, red-stained figure. It was the\n",
        "giant who wore the gemmed headband. A squat pursuer was close behind, and the black turned, at the\n",
        "very brink of the pool. In his extremity he had picked up a sword dropped by a dying sailor, and as the\n",
        "Zingaran rushed recklessly at him, he struck with the unfamiliar weapon. The buccaneer dropped with\n",
        "his skull crushed, but so awkwardly the blow was dealt, the blade shivered in the giant's hand.\n",
        "He hurled the hilt at the figures which thronged the arch, and bounded toward the pool, his face a\n",
        "convulsed mask of hate.\n",
        "Conan burst through the men at the gate, and his feet spurned the sward in his headlong charge.\n",
        "But the giant threw his great arms wide and from his lips rang an inhuman cry--the only sound made by\n",
        "a black during the entire fight. It screamed to the sky its awful hate; it was like a voice howling from the\n",
        "pits. At the sound the Zingarans faltered and hesitated. But Conan did not pause. Silently and\n",
        "murderously he drove at the ebon figure poised on the brink of the pool.\n",
        "But even as his dripping sword gleamed in the air, the black wheeled and bounded high. For a flash of an\n",
        "instant they saw him poised in midair above the pool; then with an earth-shaking roar, the green waters\n",
        "rose and rushed up to meet him, enveloping him in a green volcano.\n",
        "Conan checked his headlong rush just in time to keep from toppling into the pool, and he sprang back,\n",
        "thrusting his men behind him with mighty swings of his arms. The green pool was like a geyser now, the\n",
        "noise rising to deafening volume as the great column of water reared and reared, blossoming at the crest\n",

        "paralyzed, staring with wide-eyed terror at the seething pillar, he accosted her with a bellow that cut \n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "128\n",
        "through the thunder of the water and made her jump out of her daze. She ran to him, arms outstretched,\n",
        "and he caught her up under one arm and raced out of the court.\n",
        "In the court which opened on the outer world, the survivors had gathered, weary, tattered, wounded and\n",
        "blood-stained, and stood gaping dumbly at the great unstable pillar that towered momentarily nearer the\n",
        "blue vault of the sky. Its green trunk was laced with white; its foaming crown was thrice the\n",
        "circumference of its base. Momentarily it threatened to burst and fall in an engulfing torrent, yet it\n",
        "continued to jet skyward.\n",
        "Conan's eyes swept the bloody, naked group, and he cursed to see only a score. In the stress of the\n",

        "spattered all near them.\n",
        "\"Where are the rest?\" he bellowed in his victim's ear.\n",
        "\"That's all!\" the other yelled back, above the roar of the geyser. \"The others were all killed by those black-\"\n",
        "\"Well, get out of here!\" roared Conan, giving him a thrust that sent him staggering headlong toward the\n",
        "outer archway. \"That fountain is going to burst in a moment-\"\n",
        "\"We'll all be drowned!\" squawked a Freebooter, limping toward the arch.\n",
        "\"Drowned, hell!\" yelled Conan. \"We'll be turned to pieces of petrified bone! Get out, blast you!\"\n",
        "He ran to the outer archway, one eye on the green roaring tower that loomed so awfully above him, the\n",
        "other on stragglers. Dazed with blood-lust, fighting, and the thunderous noise, some of the Zingarans\n",
        "moved like men in a trance. Conan hurried them up; his method was simple. He grasped loiterers by the\n",
        "scruff of the neck, impelled them violently through the gate, added impetus with a lusty kick in the rear,\n",
        "spicing his urgings for haste with pungent comments on the victim's ancestry. Sancha showed an\n",
        "inclination to remain with him, but he jerked away her twining arms, blaspheming luridly, and\n",
        "accelerated her movements with a tremendous slap on the posterior that sent her scurrying across the\n",

        "the towers, and he too fled that castle of nameless horrors.\n",
        "The Zingarans had already crossed the rim of the plateau and were fleeing down the slopes. Sancha\n",
        "waited for him at the crest of the first slope beyond the rim, and there he paused for an instant to look\n",
        "back at the castle. It was as if a gigantic green-stemmed and white-blossomed flower swayed above the\n",
        "towers; the roar filled the sky. Then the jade-green and snowy pillar broke with a noise like the rending of\n",
        "the skies, and walls and towers were blotted out in a thunderous torrent.\n",
        "Conan caught the girl's hand, and fled. Slope after slope rose and fell before them, and behind sounded\n",
        "the rushing of a river. A glance over his straining shoulder showed a broad green ribbon rising and\n",
        "falling as it swept over the slopes. The torrent had not spread out and dissipated; like a giant serpent it\n",
        "flowed over the depressions and the rounded crests. It held a consistent course--it was following them.\n",
        "The Pool of the Black One\n",
        "129\n",
        "The realization roused Conan to a greater pitch of endurance. Sancha stumbled and went to her knees\n",

        "sailors.\n",
        "With hearts ready to burst from exhaustion, they pulled for the ship. The green river burst through the\n",
        "fringe of trees. Those trees fell as if their stems had been cut away, and as they sank into the jade-colored\n",

        "deeper, more sinister green.\n",
        "Unreasoning, instinctive fear held the buccaneers, making them urge their agonized bodies and reeling\n",
        "brains to greater effort; what they feared they knew not, but they did know that in that abominable\n",

        "into the waves and stream through the water toward them, without altering its shape or course, he called\n",
        "up his last ounce of reserve strength so fiercely that the oar snapped in his hands.\n",
        "But their prows bumped against the timbers of the Wastrel, and the sailors staggered up the chains,\n",
        "leaving the boats to drift as they would. Sancha went up on Conan's broad shoulder, hanging limp as a\n",
        "corpse, to be dumped unceremoniously on to the deck as the Barachan took the wheel, gasping orders to\n",
        "his skeleton of a crew. Throughout the affair, he had taken the lead without question, and they had\n",
        "instinctively followed him. They reeled about like drunken men, fumbling mechanically at ropes and\n",
        "braces. The anchor chain, unshackled, splashed into the water, the sails unfurled and bellied in a rising\n",
        "wind. The Wastrel quivered and shook herself, and swung majestically seaward. Conan glared\n",
        "shoreward; like a tongue of emerald flame, a ribbon licked out on the water futilely, an oar's length from\n",
        "the Wastrel's keel. It advanced no further. From that end of the tongue, his gaze followed an unbroken\n",
        "stream of lambent green, across the white beach, and over the slopes, until it faded in the blue distance.\n",
        "The Barachan, regaining his wind, grinned at the panting crew. Sancha was standing near him, hysterical\n",
        "tears coursing down her cheeks. Conan's breeks hung in blood-stained tatters; his girdle and sheath were\n",
        "gone, his sword, driven upright into the deck beside him, was notched and crusted with red. Blood\n",
        "thickly clotted his black mane, and one ear had been half torn from his head. His arms, legs, breast and\n",
        "shoulders were bitten and clawed as if by panthers. But he grinned as he braced his powerful legs, and\n",
        "swung on the wheel in sheer exuberance of muscular might.\n",
        "\"What now?\" faltered the girl.\n",
        "\"The plunder of the seas!\" he laughed. \"A paltry crew, and that chewed and clawed to pieces, but they can\n",
        "work the ship, and crews can always be found. Come here, girl, and give me a kiss.\"\n",
        "\"A kiss?\" she cried hysterically. \"You think of kisses at a time like this?\"\n",
        "His laughter boomed above the snap and thunder of the sails, as he caught her up off her feet in the crook\n",

        "Both were tall men, built like tigers. Their shields were gone, their corselets battered and dinted. Blood\n",

        "reeled he thrust with all the power of his broad shoulders behind the humming blade. The sharp point\n",
        "tore through brass scales and bones and heart, and the red-haired warrior died at Conan's feet.\n",
        "The Cimmerian stood upright, trailing his sword, a sudden sick weariness assailing him. The glare of the\n",

        "A silvery laugh cut through his dizziness, and his sight cleared slowly. He looked up; there was a\n",

        "But he did not think long of this. Before him, swaying like a sapling in the wind, stood a woman. Her\n",
        "body was like ivory to his dazed gaze, and save for a light veil of gossamer, she was naked as the day.\n",

        "they were neither red nor yellow but a glorious compound of both colors. He gazed spell-bound. Her hair\n",
        "was like elfin-gold; the sun struck it so dazzlingly that he could scarcely bear to look upon it. Her eyes\n",
        "were likewise neither wholly blue nor wholly grey, but of shifting colors and dancing lights and clouds of\n",
        "colors he could not define. Her full red lips smiled, and from her slender feet to the blinding crown of her\n",

        "numb from the blow of the survivor, from which the Cimmerian's mail had barely saved his life. Conan\n",

        "wonder at the hidden meaning therein. No words passed between them, but Nabonidus bowed and\n",
        "handed Murilo a small gold cask. The young nobleman, knowing that Nabonidus did nothing without\n",

        "had learned through his secret channels that the Cimmerian had been captured, he had seen a solution of\n",

        "Nabonidus, and an eery obsession began to grow on him that the Red Priest was more than human--a\n",
        "sorcerer who read the minds of his victims and pulled strings on which they danced like puppets. With\n",
        "despair came desperation. Girding a sword beneath his black cloak, he left his house by a hidden way\n",
        "and hurried through the deserted streets. It was just at midnight when he came to the house of\n",
        "Nabonidus, looming blackly among the walled gardens that separated it from the surrounding estates.\n",
        "The wall was high but not impossible to negotiate. Nabonidus did not put his trust in mere barriers of\n",
        "stone. It was what was inside the wall that was to be feared. What these things were Murilo did not know\n",
        "precisely. He knew there was at least a huge savage dog that roamed the gardens and had on occasion\n",
        "torn an intruder to pieces as a hound rends a rabbit. What else there might be he did not care to\n",
        "conjecture. Men who had been allowed to enter the house on brief, legitimate business, reported that\n",
        "Nabonidus dwelt among rich furnishings, yet simply, attended by a surprisingly small number of\n",
        "servants. Indeed, they mentioned only one as having been visible--a tall, silent man called Joka. Some one\n",
        "else, presumably a slave, had been heard moving about in the recesses of the house, but this person no\n",
        "one had ever seen. The greatest mystery of the mysterious house was Nabonidus himself, whose power\n",
        "of intrigue and grasp on international politics had made him the strongest man in the kingdom. People,\n",

        "Murilo scaled the wall and dropped down into the gardens, which were expanses of shadow, darkened\n",
        "by clumps of shrubbery and waving foliage. No light shone in the windows of the house, which loomed\n",
        "so blackly among the trees. The young nobleman stole stealthily yet swiftly through the shrubs.\n",
        "Momentarily he expected to hear the baying of the great dog and to see its giant body hurtle through the\n",
        "shadows. He doubted the effectiveness of his sword against such an attack, but he did not hesitate. As\n",
        "well die beneath the fangs of a beast as of the headsman.\n",
        "He stumbled over something bulky and yielding. Bending close in the dim starlight, he made out a limp\n",
        "shape on the ground. It was the dog that guarded the gardens, and it was dead. Its neck was broken and\n",
        "it bore what seemed to be the marks of great fangs. Murilo felt that no human being had done this. The\n",
        "beast had met a monster more savage than itself. Murilo glared nervously at the cryptic masses of bush\n",
        "and shrub; then with a shrug of his shoulders, he approached the silent house.\n",
        "The first door he tried proved to be unlocked. He entered warily, sword in hand, and found himself in a\n",
        "long, shadowy hallway dimly illuminated by a light that gleamed through the hangings at the other end.\n",
        "Complete silence hung over the whole house. Murilo glided along the hall and halted to peer through the\n",
        "hangings. He looked into a lighted room, over the windows of which velvet curtains were drawn so\n",
        "closely as to allow no beam to shine through. The room was empty, in so far as human life was concerned,\n",
        "but it had a grisly occupant, nevertheless. in the midst of a wreckage of furniture and torn hangings that\n",
        "told of a fearful struggle, lay the body of a man. The form lay on its belly, but the head was twisted about \n",
        "Rogues in the House\n",
        "140\n",
        "so that the chin rested behind a shoulder. The features, contorted into an awful grin, seemed to leer at the\n",
        "horrified nobleman.\n",
        "For the first time that night, Murilo's resolution wavered. He cast an uncertain glance back the way he\n",
        "had come. Then the memory of the headsman's block and axe steeled him, and he crossed the room,\n",
        "swerving to avoid the grinning horror sprawled in its midst. Though he had never seen the man before,\n",
        "he knew from former descriptions that it was Joka, Nabonidus' saturnine servant.\n",
        "He peered through a curtained door into a broad circular chamber, banded by a gallery half-way between\n",
        "the polished floor and the lofty ceiling. This chamber was furnished as if for a king. In the midst of it\n",
        "stood an ornate mahogany table, loaded with vessels of wine and rich viands. And Murilo stiffened. In a\n",
        "great chair whose broad back was toward him, he saw a figure whose habiliments were familiar. He\n",
        "glimpsed an arm in a red sleeve resting on the arm of the chair; the head, clad in the familiar scarlet hood\n",
        "of the gown, was bent forward as if in meditation. Just so had Murilo seen Nabonidus sit a hundred times\n",
        "in the royal court.\n",
        "Cursing the pounding of his own heart, the young nobleman stole across the chamber, sword extended,\n",
        "his whole frame poised for the thrust. His prey did not move, nor seem to hear his cautious advance. Was\n",
        "the Red Priest asleep, or was it a corpse which slumped in that great chair? The length of a single stride\n",
        "separated Murilo from his enemy, when suddenly the man in the chair rose and faced him.\n",
        "The blood went suddenly from Murilo's features. His sword fell from his fingers and rang on the\n",

        "There was no paving on the streets; mud and filth mingled in an unsavory mess. Sewers were unknown;\n",
        "refuse was dumped into the alleys to form reeking heaps and puddles. Unless a man walked with care he\n",

        "a sudden clamor, showing that the body had at last been discovered. His captive whimpered and twisted,\n",
        "renewing her importunities. Conan glanced down into the muck and slime of the alleys below; he\n",
        "listened briefly to the clamor inside and the pleas of the wench; then he dropped her with great accuracy\n",
        "into a cesspool. He enjoyed her kickings and flounderings and the concentrated venom her profanity for a\n",
        "few seconds, and even allowed himself a low rumble of laughter. Then he lifted his head, listened to the\n",
        "growing tumult within the building, and decided it was time for him to kill Nabonidus.\n",

        "\n",
        "It was a reverberating clang of metal that roused Murilo. He groaned and struggled dazedly to a sitting\n",
        "position. About him all was silence and darkness, and for an instant he was sickened with the fear that he\n",
        "was blind. Then he remembered what had gone before, and his flesh crawled. By the sense of touch he\n",
        "found that he was lying on a floor of evenly joined stone slabs. Further groping discovered a wall of the\n",
        "same material. He rose and leaned against it, trying in vain to orient himself. That he was in some sort of\n",
        "a prison seemed certain, but where and how long he was unable to guess. He remembered dimly a\n",
        "clashing noise and wondered if it had been the iron door of his dungeon closing on him, or if it betokened\n",
        "the entrance of an executioner.\n",
        "At this thought he shuddered profoundly and began to feel his way along the wall. Momentarily he\n",
        "expected to encounter the limits of his prison, but after a while he came to the conclusion that he was\n",
        "travelling down a corridor. He kept to the wall, fearful of pits of other traps, and was presently aware of\n",
        "something near him in the blackness. He could see nothing, but either his ears had caught a stealthy\n",
        "sound, or some subconscious sense warned him. He stopped short, his hair standing on end; as surely as\n",
        "he lived, he felt the presence of some living creature crouching in the darkness in front of him.\n",
        "He thought his heart would stop when a voice hissed in a barbaric accent: \"Murilo! Is it you?\"\n",
        "\"Conan!\" Limp from the reaction, the young nobleman groped in the darkness, and his hands\n",
        "encountered a pair of great naked shoulders.\n",
        "\"A good thing I recognized you,\" grunted the barbarian. \"I was about to stick you like a fattened pig.\"\n",
        "\"Where are we, in Mitra's name?\"\n",
        "\"In the pits under the Red Priest's house; but why--\"\n",
        "Rogues in the House\n",
        "143\n",
        "\"What is the time?\"\n",
        "\"Not long after midnight.\"\n",
        "Murilo shook his head, trying to assemble his scattered wits.\n",
        "\"What are you doing here?\" demanded the Cimmerian.\n",
        "\"I came to kill Nabonidus. I heard they had changed the guard at your prison--\"\n",
        "\"They did,\" growled Conan. \"I broke the new jailer's head and walked out. I would have been here hours\n",
        "agone, but I had some personal business to attend to. Well, shall we hunt for Nabonidus?\"\n",
        "Murilo shuddered. \"Conan, we are in the house of the archfiend! I came seeking a human enemy; I found\n",
        "a hairy devil out of hell!\"\n",
        "Conan grunted uncertainly; fearless as a wounded tiger as far as human foes were concerned, he had all\n",
        "the superstitious dreads of the primitive.\n",
        "\"I gained access to the house,\" whispered Murilo, as if the darkness were full of listening ears. \"In the\n",
        "outer gardens I found Nabonidus' dog mauled to death. Within the house I came upon Joka, the servant.\n",
        "His neck had been broken. Then I saw Nabonidus himself seated in his chair, clad in his accustomed garb.\n",
        "At first I thought he, too, was dead. I stole up to stab him. He rose and faced me. God!\" The memory of\n",
        "that horror struck the young nobleman momentarily speechless as he re-lived that awful instant.\n",
        "\"Conan,\" he whispered, \"it was no man that stood before me! In body and posture it was not unlike a man,\n",
        "but from the scarlet hood of the priest grinned a face of madness and nightmare! It was covered with\n",
        "black hair, from which small pig-like eyes glared redly; its nose was flat, with great flaring nostrils; its\n",
        "loose lips writhed back, disclosing huge yellow fangs, like the teeth of a dog. The hands that hung from\n",
        "the scarlet sleeves were misshapen and likewise covered with black hair. All this I saw in one glance, and\n",
        "then I was overcome with horror; my senses left me and I swooned.\"\n",
        "\"What then?\" muttered the Cimmerian uneasily.\n",
        "\"I recovered consciousness only a short time ago; the monster must have thrown me into these pits.\n",
        "Conan, I have suspected that Nabonidus was not wholly human! He is a demon--a were-thing! By day he\n",
        "moves among humanity in the guise of men, and by night he takes on his true aspect.\"\n",
        "\"That's evident,\" answered Conan. \"Everyone knows there are men who take the form of wolves at will.\n",
        "But why did he kill his servants?\"\n",
        "\"Who can delve the mind of a devil?\" replied Murilo. \"Our present interest is in getting out of this place.\n",
        "Human weapons cannot harm a were-man. How did you get in here?\"\n",
        "\"Through the sewer. I reckoned on the gardens being guarded. The sewers connect with a tunnel that lets\n",
        "into these pits. I thought to find some door leading up into the house unbolted.\"\n",
        "\"Then let us escape by the way you came!\" exclaimed Murilo. \"To the devil with it! Once out of this snakeden, we'll take our chances with the king's guardsmen and risk a flight from the city. Lead on!\"\n",
        "Rogues in the House\n",
        "144\n",
        "\"Useless,\" grunted the Cimmerian. \"The way to the sewers is barred. As I entered the tunnel, an iron grille\n",
        "crashed down from the roof. If I had not moved quicker than a flash of lightning, its spearheads would\n",
        "have pinned me to the floor like a worm. When I tried to lift it, it wouldn't move. An elephant couldn't\n",
        "shake it. Nor could anything bigger than a rabbit squirm between the bars.\"\n",
        "Murilo cursed, an icy hand playing up and down his spine. He might have known Nabonidus would not\n",
        "leave any entrance into his house unguarded. Had Conan not possessed the steel-spring quickness of a\n",
        "wild thing, that falling portcullis would have skewered him. Doubtless his walking through the tunnel\n",
        "had sprung some hidden catch that released it from the roof. As it was, both were trapped living.\n",
        "\"There's but one thing to do,\" said Murilo, sweating profusely. \"That's to search for some other exit;\n",
        "doubtless they're all set with traps, but we have no other choice.\"\n",
        "The barbarian grunted agreement, and the companions began groping their way at random down the\n",
        "corridor. Even at that moment, something occurred to Murilo.\n",
        "\"How did you recognize me in this blackness?\" he demanded.\n",
        "\"I smelled the perfume you put on your hair, when you came to my cell,\" answered Conan. \"I smelled it\n",
        "again a while ago, when I was crouching in the dark and preparing to rip you open.\"\n",
        "Murilo put a lock of his black hair to his nostrils; even so the scent was barely apparent to his civilized\n",
        "senses, and he realized how keen must be the organs of the barbarian.\n",
        "Instinctively his hand went to his scabbard as they groped onward, and he cursed to find it empty. At\n",
        "that moment a faint glow became apparent ahead of them, and presently they came to a sharp bend in the\n",
        "corridor, about which the light filtered grayly. Together they peered around the corner, and Murilo,\n",
        "leaning against his companion, felt his huge frame stiffen. The young nobleman had also seen it--the\n",
        "body of a man, half naked, lying limply in the corridor beyond the bend, vaguely illumined by a radiance\n",
        "which seemed to emanate from a broad silver disk on the farther wall. A strange familiarity about the\n",
        "recumbent figure, which lay face down, stirred Murilo with inexplicable and monstrous conjectures.\n",
        "Motioning the Cimmerian to follow him, he stole forward and bent above the body. Overcoming a certain\n",
        "repugnance, he grasped it and turned it on its back. An incredulous oath escaped him; the Cimmerian\n",
        "grunted explosively.\n",
        "\"Nabonidus! The Red Priest!\" ejaculated Murilo, his brain a dizzy vortex of whirling amazement. \"Then\n",
        "who--what -- ?\"\n",
        "The priest groaned and stirred. With catlike quickness Conan bent over him, poniard poised above his\n",
        "heart. Murilo caught his wrist.\n",
        "\"Wait! Don't kill him yet--\"\n",
        "\"Why not?\" demanded the Cimmerian. \"He has cast off his were-guise, and sleeps. Will you awaken him\n",
        "to tear us to pieces?\"\n",
        "\"No, wait!\" urged Murilo, trying to collect his jumbled wits. \"Look! He is not sleeping--see that great blue\n",
        "welt on his shaven temple? He has been knocked senseless. He may have been lying here for hours.\" \n",
        "Rogues in the House\n",
        "145\n",
        "\"I thought you swore you saw him in beastly shape in the house above,\" said Conan.\n",
        "\"I did! Or else--he's coming to! Keep back your blade, Conan; there is a mystery here even darker than I\n",
        "thought. I must have words with this priest, before we kill him.\"\n",
        "Nabonidus lifted a hand vaguely to his bruised temple, mumbled, and opened his eyes. For an instant\n",
        "they were blank and empty of intelligence; then life came back to them with a jerk, and he sat up, staring\n",
        "at the companions. Whatever terrific jolt had temporarily addled his razor-keen brain, it was functioning\n",
        "with its accustomed vigor again. His eyes shot swiftly about him, then came back to rest on Murilo's face.\n",
        "\"You honor my poor house, young sir,\" he laughed coolly, glancing at the great figure that loomed behind\n",
        "the young nobleman's shoulder. \"You have brought a bravo, I see. Was your sword not sufficient to sever\n",
        "the life of my humble self?\"\n",
        "\"Enough of this,\" impatiently returned Murilo. \"How long have you lain here?\"\n",
        "\"A peculiar question to put to a man just recovering consciousness,\" answered the priest. \"I do not know\n",
        "what time it now is. But it lacked an hour or so of midnight when I was set upon.\"\n",
        "\"Then who is it that masquerades in your own gown in the house above?\" demanded Murilo.\n",
        "\"That will be Thak,\" answered Nabonidus, ruefully fingering his bruises. \"Yes, that will be Thak. And in\n",
        "my own gown? The dog!\"\n",
        "Conan, who comprehended none of this, stirred restlessly, and growled something in his own tongue.\n",
        "Nabonidus glanced at him whimsically.\n",
        "\"Your bully's knife yearns for my heart, Murilo,\" he said. \"I thought you might be wise enough to take my\n",
        "warning and leave the city.\"\n",
        "\"How was I to know that was to be granted me?\" returned Murilo. \"At any rate, my interests are here.\"\n",
        "\"You are in good company with that cutthroat,\" murmured Nabonidus. \"I had suspected you for some\n",
        "time. That was why I caused that pallid court secretary to disappear. Before he died he told me many\n",
        "things, among others the name of the young nobleman who bribed him to filch state secrets, which the\n",
        "nobleman in turn sold to rival powers. Are you not ashamed of yourself, Murilo, you white-handed\n",
        "thief?\"\n",
        "\"I have no more cause for shame than you, you vulture-hearted plunderer,\" answered Murilo promptly.\n",
        "\"You exploit a whole kingdom for your personal greed; and, under the guise of disinterested\n",
        "statesmanship, you swindle the king, beggar the rich, oppress the poor, and sacrifice the whole future of\n",
        "the nation for your ruthless ambition. You are no more than a fat hog with his snout in the trough. You\n",
        "are a greater thief than I am. This Cimmerian is the most honest man of the three of us, because he steals\n",
        "and murders openly.\"\n",
        "\"Well, then, we are all rogues together,\" agreed Nabonidus equably. \"And what now? My life?\"\n",
        "\"When I saw the ear of the secretary that had disappeared, I knew I was doomed,\" said Murilo abruptly,\n",
        "\"and I believed you would invoke the authority of the king. Was I right?\"\n",
        "Rogues in the House\n",
        "146\n",
        "\"Quite so,\" answered the priest. \"A court secretary is easy to do away with, but you are a bit too\n",
        "prominent. I had intended telling the king a jest about you in the morning.\"\n",
        "\"A jest that would have cost me my head,\" muttered Murilo. \"The the king is unaware of my foreign\n",
        "enterprises?\"\n",
        "\"As yet,\" sighed Nabonidus. \"And now, since I see your companion has his knife, I fear that jest will never\n",
        "be told.\"\n",
        "\"You should know how to get out of these rat-dens,\" said Murilo. \"Suppose I agree to spare your life. Will\n",
        "you help us to escape, and swear to keep silent about my thievery?\"\n",
        "\"When did a priest keep an oath?\" complained Conan, comprehending the trend of the conversation. \"Let\n",
        "me cut his throat; I want to see what color his blood is. They say in the Maze that his heart is black, so his\n",
        "blood must be black, too--\"\n",
        "\"Be quiet,\" whispered Murilo. \"If he does not show us the way out of these pits, we may rot here. Well,\n",
        "Nabonidus, what do you say?\"\n",
        "\"What does a wolf with his leg in the trap say?\" laughed the priest. \"I am in your power, and, if we are to\n",
        "escape, we must aid one another. I swear, if we survive this adventure, to forget all your shifty dealings. I\n",
        "swear by the soul of Mitra!\"\n",
        "\"I am satisfied,\" muttered Murilo. \"Even the Red Priest would not break that oath. Now to get out of here.\n",
        "My friend here entered by way of the tunnel, but a grille fell behind him and blocked the way. Can you\n",
        "cause it to be lifted?\"\n",
        "\"Not from these pits,\" answered the priest. \"The control lever is in the chamber above the tunnel. There is\n",
        "only one other way out of these pits, which I will show you. But tell me, how did you come here?\"\n",
        "Murilo told him in a few words, and Nabonidus nodded, rising stiffly. He limped down the corridor,\n",
        "which here widened into a sort of vast chamber, and approached the distant silver disk. As they\n",
        "advanced the light increased, though it never became anything but a dim shadowy radiance. Near the\n",
        "disk they saw a narrow stair leading upward.\n",
        "\"That is the other exit,\" said Nabonidus. \"And I strongly doubt if the door at the head is bolted. But I have\n",
        "an idea that he who would go through that door had better cut his own throat first. Look into the disk.\"\n",
        "What had seemed a silver plate was in reality a great mirror set in the wall. A confusing system of\n",
        "copperlike tubes jutted out from the wall above it, bending down toward it at right angles. Glancing into\n",
        "these tubes, Murilo saw a bewildering array of smaller mirrors. He turned his attention to the larger\n",
        "mirror in the wall, and ejaculated in amazement. Peering over his shoulder, Conan grunted.\n",
        "They seemed to be looking through a broad window into a well-lighted chamber. There were broad\n",
        "mirrors on the walls, with velvet hangings between; there were silken couches, chairs of ebony and ivory,\n",
        "and curtained doorways leading off from the chamber. And before one doorway which was not curtained,\n",
        "sat a bulky black object that contrasted grotesquely with the richness of the chamber.\n",
        "Rogues in the House\n",
        "147\n",
        "Murilo felt his blood freeze again as he looked at the horror which seemed to be staring directly into his\n",
        "eyes. Involuntarily he recoiled from the mirror, while Conan thrust his head truculently forward, till his\n",
        "jaws almost touched the surface, growling some threat or defiance in his own barbaric tongue.\n",
        "\"In Mitra's name, Nabonidus,\" gasped Murilo, shaken, \"what is it?\"\n",
        "\"That is Thak,\" answered the priest, caressing his temple. \"Some would call him an ape, but he is almost\n",
        "as different from a real ape as he is different from a real man. His people dwell far to the east, in the\n",
        "mountains that fringe the eastern frontiers of Zamora. There are not many of them; but, if they are not\n",
        "exterminated, I believe they will become human beings in perhaps a hundred thousand years. They are in\n",
        "the formative stage; they are neither apes, as their remote ancestors were, nor men, as their remote\n",
        "descendants may be. They dwell in the high crags of well-nigh inaccessible mountains, knowing nothing\n",
        "of fire or the making of shelter or garments, or the use of weapons. Yet they have a language of a sort,\n",
        "consisting mainly of grunts and clicks.\n",
        "\"I took Thak when he was a cub, and he learned what I taught him much more swiftly and thoroughly\n",
        "than any true animal could have done. He was at once bodyguard and servant. But I forgot that being\n",
        "partly a man, he could not be submerged into a mere shadow of myself, like a true animal. Apparently\n",
        "his semi-brain retained impressions of hate, resentment, and some sort of bestial ambition of its own.\n",
        "\"At any rate, he struck when I least expected it. Last night he appeared to go suddenly mad. His actions\n",
        "had all the appearance of bestial insanity, yet I know that they must have been the result of long and\n",
        "careful planning.\n",
        "\"I heard a sound of fighting in the garden, and going to investigate--for I believed it was yourself, being\n",
        "dragged down by my watchdog--I saw Thak emerge from the shrubbery dripping with blood. Before I\n",
        "was aware of his intention, he sprang at me with an awful scream and struck me senseless. I remember\n",
        "no more, but can only surmise that, following some whim of his semi-human brain, he stripped me of my\n",
        "gown and cast me still living into the pits--for what reason, only the gods can guess. He must have killed\n",
        "the dog when he came from the garden, and after he struck me down, he evidently killed Joka, as you\n",
        "saw the man lying dead in the house. Joka would have come to my aid, even against Thak, who he\n",
        "always hated.\"\n",
        "Murilo stared in the mirror at the creature which sat with such monstrous patience before the closed door.\n",
        "He shuddered at the sight of the great black hands, thickly grown with hair that was almost furlike. The\n",
        "body was thick, broad, and stooped. The unnaturally wide shoulders had burst the scarlet gown, and on\n",
        "these shoulders Murilo noted the same thick growth of black hair. The face peering from the scarlet hood\n",
        "was utterly bestial, and yet Murilo realized that Nabonidus spoke truth when he said that Thak was not\n",
        "wholly a beast. There was something in the red murky eyes, something in the creature's clumsy posture,\n",
        "something in the whole appearance of the thing that set it apart from the truly animal. That monstrous\n",
        "body housed a brain and soul that were just budding awfully into something vaguely human. Murilo\n",
        "stood aghast as he recognized a faint and hideous kinship between his kind and that squatting\n",
        "monstrosity, and he was nauseated by a fleeting realization of the abysses of bellowing bestiality up\n",
        "through which humanity had painfully toiled.\n",
        "\"Surely he sees us,\" muttered Conan. \"Why does he not charge us? He could break this window with\n",
        "ease.\" \n",
        "Rogues in the House\n",
        "148\n",
        "Murilo realized that Conan supposed the mirror to be a window through which they were looking.\n",
        "\"He does not see us,\" answered the priest. \"We are looking into the chamber above us. That door that\n",
        "Thak is guarding is the one at the head of these stairs. It is simply an arrangement of mirrors. Do you see\n",
        "those mirrors on the walls? They transmit the reflection of the room into these tubes, down which other\n",
        "mirrors carry it to reflect it at last on an enlarged scale in this great mirror.\"\n",
        "Murilo realized that the priest must be centuries ahead of his generation, to perfect such an invention; but\n",
        "Conan put it down to witchcraft and troubled his head no more about it.\n",
        "\"I constructed these pits for a place of refuge as well as a dungeon,\" the priest was saying. \"There are\n",
        "times when I have taken refuge here and, through these mirrors, watched doom fall upon those who\n",
        "sought me with ill intent.\"\n",
        "\"But why is Thak watching that door?\" demanded Murilo.\n",
        "\"He must have heard the falling of the grating in the tunnel. It is connected with bells in the chambers\n",
        "above. He knows someone is in the pits, and he is waiting for him to come up the stairs. Oh, he has\n",
        "learned well the lessons I taught him. He has seen what happened to men who come through that door,\n",
        "when I tugged at the rope that hangs on yonder wall, and he waits to mimic me.\"\n",
        "\"And while he waits, what are we to do?\" demanded Murilo.\n",
        "\"There is naught we can do, except watch him. As long as he is in that chamber, we dare not ascend the\n",
        "stairs. He has the strength of a true gorilla and could easily tear us all to pieces. But he does not need to\n",
        "exert his muscles; if we open that door he has but to tug that rope, and blast us into eternity.\"\n",
        "\"How?\"\n",
        "\"I bargained to help you escape,\" answered the priest; \"not to betray my secrets.\"\n",
        "Murilo started to reply, then stiffened suddenly. A stealthy hand had parted the curtains of one of the\n",
        "doorways. Between them appeared a dark face whose glittering eyes fixed menacingly on the squat form\n",
        "in the scarlet robe.\n",
        "\"Petreus!\" hissed Nabonidus. \"Mitra, what a gathering of vultures this night is!\"\n",
        "The face remained framed between the parted curtains. Over the intruder's shoulder other faces peered--\n",
        "dark, thin faces, alight with sinister eagerness.\n",
        "\"What do they here?\" muttered Murilo, unconsciously lowering his voice, although he knew they could\n",
        "not hear him.\n",
        "\"Why, what would Petreus and his ardent young nationalists be doing in the house of the Red Priest?\"\n",
        "laughed Nabonidus. \"Look how eagerly they glare at the figure they think is their arch-enemy. They have\n",

        "149\n",
        "Murilo did not reply. The whole affair had a distinctly unreal atmosphere. He felt as if he were watching\n",

        "He saw Petreus put his finger warningly to his lips, and nod to his fellow conspirators. The young\n",
        "nobleman could not tell if Thak was aware of the intruders. The ape-man's position had not changed, as\n",
        "he sat with his back toward the door through which the men were gliding.\n",
        "\"They had the same idea you had,\" Nabonidus was muttering at his ear. \"Only their reasons were\n",
        "patriotic rather than selfish. Easy to gain access to my house, now that the dog is dead. Oh, what a chance\n",
        "to rid myself of their menace once and for all! If I were sitting where Thak sits--a leap to the wall--a tug on\n",
        "that rope--\"\n",
        "Petreus had placed one foot lightly over the threshold of the chamber; his fellows were at his heels, their\n",
        "daggers glinting dully. Suddenly Thak rose and wheeled toward him. The unexpected horror of his\n",
        "appearance, where they had thought to behold the hated but familiar countenance of Nabonidus,\n",
        "wrought havoc with their nerves, as the same spectacle had wrought upon Murilo. With a shriek Petreus\n",
        "recoiled, carrying his companions backward with him. They stumbled and floundered over each other;\n",
        "and in that instant Thak, covering the distance in one prodigious, grotesque leap, caught and jerked\n",
        "powerfully at a thick velvet rope which hung near the doorway.\n",
        "Instantly the curtains whipped back on either hand, leaving the door clear, and down across it something\n",
        "flashed with a peculiar silvery blur.\n",
        "\"He remembered!\" Nabonidus was exulting. \"The beast is half a man! He had seen the doom performed,\n",
        "and he remembered! Watch, now! Watch! Watch!\"\n",
        "Murilo saw that it was a panel of heavy glass that had fallen across the doorway. Through it he saw the\n",
        "pallid faces of the conspirators. Petreus, throwing out his hands as if to ward off a charge from Thak,\n",
        "encountered the transparent barrier, and from his gestures, said something to his companions. Now that\n",
        "the curtains were drawn back, the men in the pits could see all that took place in the chamber that\n",
        "contained the nationalists. Completely unnerved, these ran across the chamber toward the door by which\n",
        "they had apparently entered, only to halt suddenly, as if stopped by an invisible wall.\n",
        "\"The jerk of the rope sealed that chamber,\" laughed Nabonidus. \"It is simple; the glass panels work in\n",
        "grooves in the doorways. Jerking the rope trips the spring that holds them. They slide down and lock in\n",
        "place, and can only be worked from outside. The glass is unbreakable; a man with a mallet could not\n",
        "shatter it. Ah!\"\n",
        "The trapped men were in a hysteria of fright; they ran wildly from one door to another, beating vainly at\n",
        "the crystal walls, shaking their fists wildly at the implacable black shape which squatted outside. Then\n",
        "one threw back his head, glared upward, and began to scream, to judge from the working of his lips,\n",
        "while he pointed toward the ceiling.\n",
        "\"The fall of the panels released the clouds of doom,\" said the Red Priest with a wild laugh. \"The dust of\n",
        "the gray lotus, from the Swamps of the Dead, beyond the land of Khitai.\" \n",
        "Rogues in the House\n",
        "150\n",
        "In the middle of the ceiling hung a cluster of gold buds; these had opened like the petals of a great carven\n",
        "rose, and from them billowed a gray mist that swiftly filled the chamber. Instantly the scene changed\n",
        "from one of hysteria to one of madness and horror. The trapped men began to stagger; they ran in\n",
        "drunken circles. Froth dripped from their lips, which twisted as in awful laughter. Raging, they fell upon\n",
        "one another with daggers and teeth, slashing, tearing, slaying in a holocaust of madness. Murilo turned\n",
        "sick as he watched and was glad that he could not hear the screams and howls with which that doomed\n",
        "chamber must be ringing. Like pictures thrown on a screen, it was silent.\n",
        "Outside the chamber of horror Thak was leaping up and down in brutish glee, tossing his long hairy\n",
        "arms on high. At Murilo's shoulder Nabonidus was laughing like a fiend.\n",
        "\"Ah, a good stroke, Petreus! That fairly disemboweled him! Now one for you, my patriotic friend! So!\n",
        "They are all down, and the living tear the flesh of the dead with their slavering teeth.\"\n",
        "Murilo shuddered. Behind him the Cimmerian swore softly in his uncouth tongue. Only death was to be\n",
        "seen in the chamber of the gray mist; torn, gashed, and mangled, the conspirators lay in a red heap,\n",
        "gaping mouths and blood-dabbled faces staring blankly upward through the slowly swirling eddies of\n",
        "gray.\n",
        "Thak, stooping like a giant gnome, approached the wall where the rope hung, and gave it a peculiar\n",
        "sidewise pull.\n",
        "\"He is opening the farther door,\" said Nabonidus. \"By Mitra, he is more of a human than even I had\n",
        "guessed! See, the mist swirls out of the chamber and is dissipated. He waits, to be safe. Now he raises the\n",
        "other panel. He is cautious--he knows the doom of the gray lotus, which brings madness and death. By\n",
        "Mitra!\"\n",
        "Murilo jerked about at the electric quality of the exclamation.\n",
        "\"Our one chance!\" exclaimed Nabonidus. \"If he leaves the chamber above for a few minutes, we will risk a\n",
        "dash up those stairs.\"\n",
        "Suddenly tense, they watched the monster waddle through the doorway and vanish. With the lifting of\n",
        "the glass panel, the curtains had fallen again, hiding the chamber of death.\n",
        "\"We must chance it!\" gasped Nabonidus, and Murilo saw perspiration break out on his face. \"Perhaps he\n",
        "will be disposing of the bodies as he has seen me do. Quick! Follow me up those stairs!\"\n",
        "He ran toward the steps and up them with an agility that amazed Murilo. The young nobleman and the\n",
        "barbarian were close at his heels, and they heard his gusty sigh of relief as he threw open the door at the\n",
        "top of the stairs. They burst into the broad chamber they had seen mirrored below. Thak was nowhere to\n",
        "be seen.\n",
        "\"He's in that chamber with the corpses!\" exclaimed Murilo. \"Why not trap him there as he trapped them?\"\n",
        "\"No, no!\" gasped Nabonidus, an unaccustomed pallor tingeing his features. \"We do not know that he is in\n",
        "there. He might emerge before we could reach the trap rope, anyway! Follow me into the corridor; I must\n",
        "reach my chamber and obtain weapons which will destroy him. This corridor is the only one opening\n",
        "from this chamber which is not set with a trap of some kind.\" \n",
        "Rogues in the House\n",
        "151\n",
        "They followed him swiftly through a curtained doorway opposite the door of the death chamber and\n",
        "came into a corridor, into which various chambers opened. With fumbling haste Nabonidus began to try\n",
        "the doors on each side. They were locked, as was the door at the other end of the corridor.\n",
        "\"My god!\" The Red Priest leaned against the wall, his skin ashen. \"The doors are locked, and Thak took\n",
        "my keys from me. We are trapped, after all.\"\n",
        "Murilo stared appalled to see the man in such a state of nerves, and Nabonidus pulled himself together\n",
        "with an effort.\n",
        "\"The beast has me in a panic,\" he said. \"If you had seen him tear men as I have seen--well, Mitra aid us,\n",
        "but we must fight him now with what the gods have given us. Come!\"\n",
        "He led them back to the curtained doorway, and peered into the great chamber in time to see Thak\n",
        "emerge from the opposite doorway. It was apparent that the beast-man had suspected something. His\n",
        "small, close-set ears twitched; he glared angrily about him and, approaching the nearest doorway, tore\n",
        "aside the curtains to look behind them.\n",
        "Nabonidus drew back, shaking like a leaf. He gripped Conan's shoulder. \"Man, do you dare pit your\n",
        "knife against his fangs?\"\n",
        "The Cimmerian's eyes blazed in answer.\n",
        "\"Quick!\" the Red Priest whispered, thrusting him behind the curtains, close against the wall. \"As he will\n",
        "find us soon enough, we will draw him to us. As he rushes past you, sink your blade in his back if you\n",
        "can. You, Murilo, show yourself to him and then flee up the corridor. Mitra knows, we have no chance\n",
        "with him in hand-to-hand combat, but we are doomed anyway when he finds us.\"\n",
        "Murilo felt his blood congeal in his veins, but he steeled himself and stepped outside the doorway.\n",
        "Instantly Thak, on the other side of the chamber, wheeled, glared, and charged with a thunderous roar.\n",
        "His scarlet hood had fallen back, revealing his black misshapen head; his black hands and red robe were\n",
        "splashed with a brighter red. He was like a crimson and black nightmare as he rushed across the chamber,\n",
        "fangs barred, his bowed legs hurtling his enormous body along at a terrifying gait.\n",
        "Murilo turned and ran back into the corridor and, quick as he was, the shaggy horror was almost at his\n",
        "heels. Then as the monster rushed past the curtains, from among them catapulted a great form that struck\n",
        "full on the ape-man's shoulders, at the same instant driving the poniard into the brutish back. Thak\n",
        "screamed horribly as the impact knocked him off his feet, and the combatants hit the floor together.\n",
        "Instantly there began a whirl and thrash of limbs, the tearing and rending of a fiendish battle.\n",
        "Murilo saw that the barbarian had locked his legs about the ape-man's torso and was striving to maintain\n",
        "his position on the monster's back while he butchered it with his poniard. Thak, on the other hand, was\n",
        "striving to dislodge his clinging foe, to drag him around within reach of the giant fangs that gaped for his\n",
        "flesh. In a whirlwind of blows and scarlet tatters they rolled along the corridor, revolving so swiftly that\n",
        "Murilo dared not use the chair he had caught up, lest he strike the Cimmerian. And he saw that in spite of\n",
        "the handicap of Conan's first hold, and the voluminous robe that lashed and wrapped about the apeman's limbs and body, Thak's giant strength was swiftly prevailing. Inexorably he was dragging the\n",
        "Cimmerian around in front of him. The ape-man had taken punishment enough to have killed a dozen \n",
        "Rogues in the House\n",
        "152\n",
        "men. Conan's poniard had sunk again and again into his torso, shoulders, and bull-like neck; he was\n",
        "streaming blood from a score of wounds; but, unless the blade quickly reached some absolutely vital spot,\n",
        "Thak's inhuman vitality would survive to finish the Cimmerian and, after him, Conan's companions.\n",
        "Conan was fighting like a wild beast himself, in silence except for his gasps of effort. The black talons of\n",
        "the monster and the awful grasp of those misshapen hands ripped and tore at him, the grinning jaws\n",
        "gaped for his throat. Then Murilo, seeing an opening, sprang and swung the chair with all his power, and\n",
        "with force enough to have brained a human being. The chair glanced from Thak's slanted black skull; but\n",
        "the stunned monster momentarily relaxed his rending grasp, and in that instant Conan, gasping and\n",
        "streaming blood, plunged forward and sank his poniard to the hilt in the ape-man's heart.\n",
        "With a convulsive shudder, the beast-man started from the floor, then sank limply back. His fierce eyes\n",
        "set and glazed, his thick limbs quivered and became rigid.\n",
        "Conan staggered dizzily up, shaking the sweat and blood out of his eyes. Blood dripped from his poniard\n",
        "and fingers, and trickled in rivulets down his thighs, arms, and breast. Murilo caught at him to support\n",
        "him, but the barbarian shook him off impatiently.\n",
        "\"When I cannot stand alone, it will be time to die,\" he mumbled, through mashed lips. \"But I'd like a\n",
        "flagon of wine.\"\n",
        "Nabonidus was staring down at the still figure as if he could not believe his own eyes. Black, hairy,\n",
        "abhorrent, the monster lay, grotesque in the tatters of the scarlet robe; yet more human than bestial, even\n",
        "so, and possessed somehow of a vague and terrible pathos.\n",
        "Even the Cimmerian sensed this, for he panted: \"I have slain a man tonight, not a beast. I will count him\n",
        "among the chiefs whose souls I've sent into the dark, and my women will sing of him.\"\n",
        "Nabonidus stooped and picked up a bunch of keys on a golden chain. They had fallen from the apeman's girdle during the battle. Motioning his companions to follow him, he led them to a chamber,\n",
        "unlocked the door, and led the way inside. It was illumined like the others. The Red Priest took a vessel\n",
        "of wine from a table and filled crystal beakers. As his companions drank thirstily, he murmured: \"What a\n",
        "night! It is nearly dawn, now. What of you, my friends?\"\n",
        "\"I'll dress Conan's hurts, if you will fetch me bandages and the like,\" said Murilo, and Nabonidus nodded,\n",
        "and moved toward the door that led into the corridor. Something about his bowed head caused Murilo to\n",
        "watch him sharply. At the door the Red Priest wheeled suddenly. His face had undergone a\n",
        "transformation. His eyes gleamed with his old fire, his lips laughed soundlessly.\n",
        "\"Rogues together!\" his voice rang with its accustomed mockery. \"But not fools together. You are the fool,\n",
        "Murilo!\"\n",
        "\"What do you mean?\" The young nobleman started forward.\n",
        "\"Back!\" Nabonidus' voice cracked like a whip. \"Another step and I will blast you!\"\n",
        "Murilo's blood turned cold as he saw that the Red Priest's hand grasped a thick velvet rope, which hung\n",
        "among the curtains just outside the door.\n",
        "Rogues in the House\n",
        "153\n",
        "\"What treachery is this?\" cried Murilo. \"You swore--\"\n",
        "\"I swore I would not tell the king a jest concerning you! I did not swear not to take matters into my own\n",
        "hands if I could. Do you think I would pass up such an opportunity? Under ordinary circumstances I\n",
        "would not dare to kill you myself, without sanction of the king, but now none will ever know. You will\n",
        "go into the acid vats along with Thak and the nationalist fools, and none will be the wiser. What a night\n",
        "this has been for me! If I have lost some valuable servants, I have nevertheless rid myself of various\n",
        "dangerous enemies. Stand back! I am over the threshold, and you cannot possibly reach me before I tug\n",
        "this cord and send you to Hell. Not the gray lotus, this time, but something just as effective. Nearly every\n",
        "chamber in my house is a trap. And so, Murilo, fool that you are--\"\n",
        "Too quickly for the sight to follow, Conan caught up a stool and hurled it. Nabonidus instinctively threw\n",
        "up his arm with a cry, but not in time. The missile crunched against his head, and the Red Priest swayed\n",
        "and fell facedown in a slowly widening pool of dark crimson.\n",
        "\"His blood was red, after all,\" grunted Conan.\n",
        "Murilo raked back his sweat-plastered hair with a shaky hand as he leaned against the table, weak from\n",
        "the reaction of relief.\n",
        "\"It is dawn,\" he said. \"Let us get out of here, before we fall afoul of some other doom. If we can climb the\n",
        "outer wall without being seen, we shall not be connected with this night's work. Let the police write their\n",
        "own explanation.\"\n",
        "He glanced at the body of the Red Priest where it lay etched in crimson, and shrugged his shoulders.\n",
        "\"He was the fool, after all; had he not paused to taunt us, he could have trapped us easily.\"\n",
        "\"Well,\" said the Cimmerian tranquilly, \"he's travelled the road all rogues must walk at last. I'd like to loot\n",
        "the house, but I suppose we'd best go.\"\n",
        "As they emerged from the dimness of the dawn-whitened garden, Murilo said: \"The Red Priest has gone\n",
        "into the dark, so my road is clear in the city, and I have nothing to fear. But what of you? There is still the\n",
        "matter of that priest in the Maze, and--\"\n",
        "\"I'm tired of this city anyway,\" grinned the Cimmerian. \"You mentioned a horse waiting at the Rats' Den.\n",
        "I'm curious to see how fast that horse can carry me into another kingdom. There's many a highway I want\n",
        "to travel before I walk the road Nabonidus walked this night.\"\n",
        "THE END\n",
        "154\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "\n",
        "I\n",
        "\n",
        "A swift crashing of horses through the tall reeds; a heavy fall, a despairing cry. From the dying steed\n",
        "there staggered up its rider, a slender girl in sandals and girdled tunic. Her dark hair fell over her white\n",
        "shoulders, her eyes were those of a trapped animal. She did not look at the jungle of reeds that hemmed\n",
        "in the little clearing, nor at the blue waters that lapped the low shore behind her. Her wide-eyed gaze was\n",
        "fixed in agonized intensity on the horseman who pushed through the reedy screen and dismounted\n",
        "before her.\n",
        "He was a tall man, slender, but hard as steel. From head to heel he was clad in light silvered mesh-mail\n",
        "that fitted his supple form like a glove. From under the dome-shaped, gold-chased helmet his brown eyes\n",
        "regarded her mockingly.\n",
        "\"Stand back!\" her voice shrilled with terror. \"Touch me not, Shah Amurath, or I will throw myself into the\n",
        "water and drown!\"\n",
        "He laughed, and his laughter was like the purr of a sword sliding from a silken sheath.\n",
        "\"No, you will not drown, Olivia, daughter of confusion, for the marge is too shallow, and I can catch you\n",
        "before you can reach the deeps. You gave me a merry chase, by the gods, and all my men are far behind\n",
        "us. But there is no horse west of Vilayet that can distance Item for long.\" He nodded at the tall, slenderlegged desert stallion behind him.\n",
        "\"Let me go!\" begged the girl, tears of despair staining her face. \"Have I not suffered enough? Is there any\n",
        "humiliation, pain or degradation you have not heaped on me? How long must my torment last?\"\n",
        "\"As long as I find pleasure in your whimperings, your pleas, tears and writhings,\" he answered with a\n",
        "smile that would have seemed gentle to a stranger. \"You are strangely virile, Olivia. I wonder if I shall\n",
        "ever weary of you, as I have always wearied of women before. You are ever fresh and unsullied, in spite\n",
        "of me. Each new day with you brings a new delight.\n",
        "\"But come--let us return to Akif, where the people are still feting the conqueror of the miserable kozaki;\n",
        "while he, the conqueror, is engaged in recapturing a wretched fugitive, a foolish, lovely, idiotic runaway!\"\n",
        "\"No!\" She recoiled, turning toward the waters lapping bluely among the reeds.\n",
        "\"Yes!\" His flash of open anger was like a spark struck from flint. With a quickness her tender limbs could\n",
        "not approximate, he caught her wrist, twisting it in pure wanton cruelty until she screamed and sank to\n",
        "her knees.\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "155\n",
        "\"Slut! I should drag you back to Akif at my horse's tail, but I will be merciful and carry you on my saddlebow, for which favor you shall humbly thank me, while--\"\n",
        "He released her with a startled oath and sprang back, his saber flashing out, as a terrible apparition burst\n",
        "from the reedy jungle sounding an inarticulate cry of hate.\n",
        "Olivia, staring up from the ground, saw what she took to be either a savage or a madman advancing on\n",
        "Shah Amurath in an attitude of deadly menace. He was powerfully built, naked but for a girdled loincloth, which was stained with blood and crusted with dried mire. His black mane was matted with mud\n",
        "and clotted blood; there were streaks of dried blood on his chest and limbs, dried blood on the long\n",
        "straight sword he gripped in his right hand. From under the tangle of his locks, bloodshot eyes glared\n",
        "like coals of blue fire.\n",
        "\"You Hyrkanian dog!\" mouthed this apparition in a barbarous accent. \"The devils of vengeance have\n",
        "brought you here!\"\n",
        "\"Kozak!\" ejaculated Shah Amurath, recoiling. \"I did not know a dog of you escaped! I thought you all lay\n",
        "stiff on the steppe, by Ilbars River.\"\n",
        "\"All but me, damn you!\" cried the other. \"Oh, I've dreamed of such a meeting as this, while I crawled on\n",
        "my belly through the brambles, or lay under rocks while the ants gnawed my flesh, or crouched in the\n",
        "mire up to my mouth--I dreamed, but never hoped it would come to pass. Oh, gods of Hell, how I have\n",
        "yearned for this!\"\n",
        "The stranger's bloodthirsty joy was terrible to behold. His jaws champed spasmodically, froth appeared\n",
        "on his blackened lips.\n",
        "\"Keep back!\" ordered Shah Amurath, watching him narrowly.\n",
        "\"Ha!\" It was like the bark of a timber wolf. \"Shah Amurath, the great Lord of Akif! Oh, damn you, how I\n",
        "love the sight of you--you, who fed my comrades to the vultures, who tore them between wild horses,\n",
        "blinded and maimed and mutilated them all, you dog, you filthy dog!\" His voice rose to a maddened\n",
        "scream, and he charged.\n",
        "In spite of the terror of his wild appearance, Olivia looked to see him fall at the first crossing of the blades.\n",
        "Madman or savage, what could he do, naked, against the mailed chief of Akif?\n",
        "There was an instant when the blades flamed and licked, seeming barely to touch each other and leap\n",
        "apart; then the broadsword flashed past the saber and descended terrifically on Shah Amurath's shoulder.\n",
        "Olivia cried out at the fury of that stroke. Above the crunch of the rending mail, she distinctly heard the\n",
        "snap of the shoulder-bone. The Hyrkanian reeled back, suddenly ashen, blood spurting over the links of\n",
        "his hauberk; his saber slipped from his nerveless fingers.\n",
        "\"Quarter!\" he gasped.\n",
        "\"Quarter?\" There was a quiver of frenzy in the stranger's voice. \"Quarter such as you gave us, you swine!\"\n",
        "Olivia closed her eyes. This was no longer battle, but butchery, frantic, bloody, impelled by an hysteria of\n",
        "fury and hate, in which culminated the sufferings of battle, massacre, torture, and fear-ridden, thirst-\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "156\n",
        "maddened, hunger-haunted flight. Though Olivia knew that Shah Amurath deserved no mercy or pity\n",
        "from any living creature, yet she closed her eyes and pressed her hands over her ears, to shut out the\n",
        "sight of that dripping sword that rose and fell with the sound of a butcher's cleaver, and the gurgling\n",
        "cries that dwindled away and ceased.\n",
        "She opened her eyes, to see the stranger turning away from a gory travesty that only vaguely resembled a\n",
        "human being. The man's breast heaved with exhaustion or passion; his brow was beaded with sweat; his\n",
        "right hand was splashed with blood.\n",
        "He did not speak to her, or even glance toward her. She saw him stride through the reeds that grew at the\n",
        "water's edge, stoop, and tug at something. A boat wallowed out of its hiding place among the stalks.\n",
        "Then she divined his intention, and was galvanized into action.\n",
        "\"Oh, wait!\" she wailed, staggering up and running toward him. \"Do not leave me! Take me with you!\"\n",
        "He wheeled and stared at her. There was a difference in his bearing. His bloodshot eyes were sane. It was\n",
        "as if the blood he had just shed had quenched the fire of his frenzy.\n",
        "\"Who are you?\" he demanded.\n",
        "\"I am called Olivia. I was his captive. I ran away. He followed me. That's why he came here. Oh, do not\n",
        "leave me here! His warriors are not far behind him. They will find his corpse--they will find me near it--\n",
        "oh!\" She moaned in her terror and wrung her white hands.\n",
        "He stared at her in perplexity.\n",
        "\"Would you be better off with me?\" he demanded. \"I am a barbarian, and I know from your looks that\n",
        "you fear me.\"\n",
        "\"Yes, I fear you,\" she replied, too distracted to dissemble. \"My flesh crawls at the horror of your aspect.\n",
        "But I fear the Hyrkanians more. Oh, let me go with you! They will put me to the torture if they find me\n",
        "beside their dead lord.\"\n",
        "\"Come, then.\" He drew aside, and she stepped quickly into the boat, shrinking from contact with him. She\n",
        "seated herself in the bow, and he stepped into the boat, pushed off with an oar, and using it as a paddle,\n",
        "worked his way tortuously among the tall stalks until they glided out into open water. Then he set to\n",
        "work with both oars, rowing with great, smooth, even strokes, the heavy muscles of arms and shoulders\n",
        "and back rippling in rhythm to his exertions.\n",
        "There was silence for some time, the girl crouching in the bows, the man tugging at the oars. She watched\n",
        "him with timorous fascination. It was evident that he was not an Hyrkanian, and he did not resemble the\n",
        "Hyborian races. There was a wolfish hardness about him that marked the barbarian. His features,\n",
        "allowing for the strains and stains of battle and his hiding in the marshes, reflected that same untamed\n",
        "wildness, but they were neither evil nor degenerate.\n",
        "\"Who are you?\" she asked. \"Shah Amurath called you a kozak; were you of that band?\"\n",
        "\"I am Conan, of Cimmeria,\" he grunted. \"I was with the kozaki, as the Hyrkanian dogs called us.\"\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "157\n",
        "She knew vaguely that the land he named lay far to the northwest, beyond the farthest boundaries of the\n",
        "different kingdoms of her race.\n",
        "\"I am a daughter of the king of Ophir,\" she said. \"My father sold me to a Shemite chief, because I would\n",
        "not marry a prince of Koth.\"\n",
        "The Cimmerian grunted in surprize.\n",
        "Her lips twisted in a bitter smile. \"Aye, civilized men sell their children as slaves to savages, sometimes.\n",
        "They call your race barbaric, Conan of Cimmeria.\"\n",
        "\"We do not sell our children,\" he growled, his chin jutting truculently.\n",
        "\"Well--I was sold. But the desert man did not misuse me. He wished to buy the good will of Shah\n",
        "Amurath, and I was among the gifts he brought to Akif of the purple gardens. Then--\" She shuddered\n",
        "and hid her face in her hands.\n",
        "\"I should be lost to all shame,\" she said presently. \"Yet each memory stings me like a slaver's whip. I\n",
        "abode in Shah Amurath's palace, until some weeks agone he rode out with his hosts to do battle with a\n",
        "band of invaders who were ravaging the borders of Turan. Yesterday he returned in triumph, and a great\n",
        "fete was made to honor him. In the drunkenness and rejoicing, I found an opportunity to steal out of the\n",
        "city on a stolen horse. I had thought to escape--but he followed, and about midday came up with me. I\n",
        "outran his vassals, but him I could not escape. Then you came.\"\n",
        "\"I was lying hid in the reeds,\" grunted the barbarian. \"I was one of those dissolute rogues, the Free\n",
        "Companions, who burned and looted along the borders. There were five thousand of us, from a score of\n",
        "races and tribes. We had been serving as mercenaries for a rebel prince in eastern Korb, most of us, and\n",
        "when he made peace with his cursed sovereign, we were out of employment; so we took to plundering\n",
        "the outlying dominions of Koth, Zamora and Turan impartially. A week ago Shah Amurath trapped us\n",
        "near the banks of Ilbars with fifteen thousand men. Mitra! The skies were black with vultures. When the\n",
        "lines broke, after a whole day of fighting, some tried to break through to the north, some to the west. I\n",
        "doubt if any escaped. The steppes were covered with horsemen riding down the fugitives. I broke for the\n",
        "east, and finally reached the edge of the marshes that border this part of Vilayet.\n",
        "\"I've been hiding in the morasses ever since. Only the day before yesterday the riders ceased beating up\n",
        "the reed-brakes, searching for just such fugitives as I. I've squirmed and burrowed and hidden like a\n",
        "snake, feasting on muskrats I caught and ate raw, for lack of fire to cook them. This dawn I found this\n",
        "boat hidden among the reeds. I hadn't intended going out on the sea until night, but after I killed Shah\n",
        "Amurath, I knew his mailed dogs would be close at hand.\"\n",
        "\"And what now?\"\n",
        "\"We shall doubtless be pursued. If they fail to see the marks left by the boat, which I covered as well as I\n",
        "could, they'll guess anyway that we took to sea, after they fail to find us among the marshes. But we have\n",
        "a start, and I'm going to haul at these oars until we reach a safe place.\"\n",
        "\"Where shall we find that?\" she asked hopelessly. \"Vilayet is an Hyrkanian pond.\"\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "158\n",
        "\"Some folk don't think so,\" grinned Conan grimly; \"notably the slaves that have escaped from galleys and\n",
        "become pirates.\"\n",
        "\"But what are your plans?\"\n",
        "\"The southwestern shore is held by the Hyrkanians for hundreds of miles. We still have a long way to go\n",
        "before we pass beyond their northern boundaries. I intend to go northward until I think we have passed\n",
        "them. Then we'll turn westward, and try to land on the shore bordered by the uninhabited steppes.\"\n",
        "\"Suppose we meet pirates, or a storm?\" she asked. \"And we shall starve on the steppes.\"\n",
        "\"Well,\" he reminded her, \"I didn't ask you to come with me.\"\n",
        "\"I am sorry.\" She bowed her shapely dark head. \"Pirates, storms, starvation--they are--all kinder than the\n",
        "people of Turan.\"\n",
        "\"Aye.\" His dark face grew somber. \"I haven't done with them yet. Be at ease, girl. Storms are rare on\n",
        "Vilayet at this time of year. If we make the steppes, we shall not starve. I was reared in a naked land. It\n",
        "was those cursed marshes, with their stench and stinging flies, that nigh unmanned me. I am at home in\n",
        "the high lands. As for pirates--\" He grinned enigmatically, and bent to the oars.\n",
        "The sun sank like a dull-glowing copper ball into a lake of fire. The blue of the sea merged with the blue\n",
        "of the sky, and both turned to soft dark velvet, clustered with stars and the mirrors of stars. Olivia\n",
        "reclined in the bows of the gently rocking boat, in a state dreamy and unreal. She experienced an illusion\n",
        "that she was floating in midair, stars beneath her as well as above. Her silent companion was etched\n",
        "vaguely against the softer darkness. There was no break or falter in the rhythm of his oars; he might have\n",
        "been a fantasmal oarsman, rowing her across the dark lake of Death. But the edge of her fear was dulled,\n",
        "and, lulled by the monotony of motion, she passed into a quiet slumber.\n",
        "Dawn was in her eyes when she awakened, aware of a ravenous hunger. It was a change in the motion of\n",
        "the boat that had roused her; Conan was resting on his oars, gazing beyond her. She realized that he had\n",
        "rowed all night without pause, and marvelled at his iron endurance. She twisted about to follow his stare,\n",
        "and saw a green wall of trees and shrubbery rising from the water's edge and sweeping away in a wide\n",
        "curve, enclosing a small bay whose waters lay still as blue glass.\n",
        "\"This is one of the many islands that dot this inland sea,\" said Conan. \"They are supposed to be\n",
        "uninhabited. I've heard the Hyrkanians seldom visit them. Besides, they generally hug the shores in their\n",
        "galleys, and we have come a long way. Before sunset we were out of sight of the mainland.\"\n",
        "With a few strokes he brought the boat in to shore and made the painter fast to the arching root of a tree\n",
        "which rose from the water's edge. Stepping ashore, he reached out a hand to help Olivia. She took it,\n",
        "wincing slightly at the bloodstains upon it, feeling a hint of the dynamic strength that lurked in the\n",
        "barbarian's thews.\n",
        "A dreamy quiet lay over the woods that bordered the blue bay. Then somewhere, far back among the\n",
        "trees, a bird lifted its morning song. A breeze whispered through the leaves, and set them to murmuring.\n",
        "Olivia found herself listening intently for something, she knew not what. What might be lurking amid\n",
        "those nameless woodlands?\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "159\n",
        "As she peered timidly into the shadows between the trees, something swept into the sunlight with a swift\n",
        "whirl of wings: a great parrot which dropped on to a leafy branch and swayed there, a gleaming image of\n",
        "jade and crimson. It turned its crested head sidewise and regarded the invaders with glittering eyes of jet.\n",
        "\"Crom!\" muttered the Cimmerian. \"Here is the grandfather of all parrots. He must be a thousand years\n",
        "old! Look at the evil wisdom of his eyes. What mysteries do you guard, Wise Devil?\"\n",
        "Abruptly the bird spread its flaming wings and, soaring from its perch, cried out harshly: \"Yagkoolan yok\n",
        "tha, xuthalla!\" and with a wild screech of horribly human laughter, rushed away through the trees to\n",
        "vanish in the opalescent shadows.\n",
        "Olivia stared after it, feeling the cold hand of nameless foreboding touch her supple spine.\n",
        "\"What did it say?\" she whispered.\n",
        "\"Human words, I'll swear,\" answered Conan; \"but in what tongue I can't say.\"\n",
        "\"Nor I,\" returned the girl. \"Yet it must have learned them from human lips. Human, or--\" she gazed into\n",
        "the leafy fastness and shuddered slightly, without knowing why.\n",
        "\"Crom, I'm hungry!\" grunted the Cimmerian. \"I could eat a whole buffalo. We'll look for fruit; but first I'm\n",
        "going to cleanse myself of this dried mud and blood. Hiding in marshes is foul business.\"\n",
        "So saying, he laid aside his sword, and wading out shoulder-deep into the blue water, went about his\n",
        "ablutions. When he emerged, his clean-cut bronze limbs shone, his streaming black mane was no longer\n",
        "matted. His blue eyes, though they smoldered with unquenchable fire, were no longer murky or bloodshot. But the tigerish suppleness of limb and the dangerous aspect of feature were not altered.\n",
        "Strapping on his sword once more, he motioned the girl to follow him, and they left the shore, passing\n",
        "under the leafy arches of the great branches. Underfoot lay a short green sward which cushioned their\n",
        "tread. Between the trunks of the trees they caught glimpses of faery-like vistas.\n",
        "Presently Conan grunted in pleasure at the sight of golden and russet globes hanging in clusters among\n",
        "the leaves. Indicating that the girl should seat herself on a fallen tree, he filled her lap with the exotic\n",
        "delicacies, and then himself fell to with unconcealed gusto.\n",
        "\"Ishtar!\" said he, between mouthfuls. \"Since Ilbars I have lived on rats, and roots I dug out of the stinking\n",
        "mud. This is sweet to the palate, though not very filling. Still, it will serve if we eat enough.\"\n",
        "Olivia was too busy to reply. The sharp edge of the Cimmerian's hunger blunted, he began to gaze at his\n",
        "fair companion with more interest than previously, noting the lustrous clusters of her dark hair, the\n",
        "peach-bloom tints of her dainty skin, and the rounded contours of her lithe figure which the scanty silk\n",
        "tunic displayed to full advantage.\n",
        "Finishing her meal, the object of his scrutiny looked up, and meeting his burning, slit-eyed gaze, she\n",
        "changed color and the remnants of the fruit slipped from her fingers.\n",
        "Without comment, he indicated with a gesture that they should continue their explorations, and rising,\n",
        "she followed him out of the trees and into a glade, the farther end of which was bounded by a dense \n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "160\n",
        "thicket. As they stepped into the open there was a ripping crash in this thicket, and Conan, bounding\n",
        "aside and carrying the girl with him, narrowly saved them from something that rushed through the air\n",
        "and struck a tree-trunk with a thunderous impact.\n",
        "Whipping out his sword, Conan bounded across the glade and plunged into the thicket. Silence ensued,\n",
        "while Olivia crouched on the sward, terrified and bewildered. Presently Conan emerged, a puzzled scowl\n",
        "on his face.\n",
        "\"Nothing in that thicket,\" he growled. \"But there was something--\"\n",
        "He studied the missile that had so narrowly missed them, and grunted incredulously, as if unable to\n",
        "credit his own senses. It was a huge block of greenish stone which lay on the sward at the foot of the tree,\n",
        "whose wood its impact had splintered.\n",
        "\"A strange stone to find on an uninhabited island,\" growled Conan.\n",
        "Olivia's lovely eyes dilated in wonder. The stone was a symmetrical block, indisputably cut and shaped\n",
        "by human hands. And it was astonishingly massive. The Cimmerian grasped it with both hands, and\n",
        "with legs braced and the muscles standing out on his arms and back in straining knots, he heaved it\n",
        "above his head and cast it from him, exerting every ounce of nerve and sinew. It fell a few feet in front of\n",
        "him. Conan swore.\n",
        "\"No man living could throw that rock across this glade. It's a task for siege engines. Yet here there are no\n",
        "mangonels or ballistas.\"\n",
        "\"Perhaps it was thrown by some such engine from afar,\" she suggested.\n",
        "He shook his head. \"It didn't fall from above. It came from yonder thicket. See how the twigs are broken?\n",
        "It was thrown as a man might throw a pebble. But who? What? Come!\"\n",
        "She hesitantly followed him into the thicket. Inside the outer ring of leafy brush, the undergrowth was\n",
        "less dense. Utter silence brooded over all. The springy sward gave no sign of footprint. Yet from this\n",
        "mysterious thicket had hurtled that boulder, swift and deadly. Conan bent closer to the sward, where the\n",
        "grass was crushed down here and there. He shook his head angrily. Even to his keen eyes it gave no clue\n",
        "as to what had stood or trodden there. His gaze roved to the green roof above their heads, a solid ceiling\n",
        "of thick leaves and interwoven arches. And he froze suddenly.\n",
        "Then rising, sword in hand, he began to back away, thrusting Olivia behind him.\n",
        "\"Out of here, quick!\" he urged in a whisper that congealed the girl's blood.\n",
        "\"What is it? What do you see?\"\n",
        "\"Nothing,\" he answered guardedly, not halting his wary retreat.\n",
        "\"But what is it, then? What lurks in this thicket?\"\n",
        "\"Death!\" he answered, his gaze still fixed on the brooding jade arches that shut out the sky.\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "161\n",
        "Once out of the thicket, he took her hand and led her swiftly through the thinning trees, until they\n",
        "mounted a grassy slope, sparsely treed, and emerged upon a low plateau, where the grass grew taller and\n",
        "the trees were few and scattered. And in the midst of that plateau rose a long broad structure of\n",
        "crumbling greenish stone.\n",
        "They gazed in wonder. No legends named such a building on any island of Vilayet. They approached it\n",
        "warily, seeing that moss and lichen crawled over the stones, and the broken roof gaped to the sky. On all\n",
        "sides lay bits and shards of masonry, half hidden in the waving grass, giving the impression that once\n",
        "many buildings rose there, perhaps a whole town. But now only the long hall-like structure rose against\n",
        "the sky, and its walls leaned drunkenly among the crawling vines.\n",
        "Whatever doors had once guarded its portals had long rotted away. Conan and his companion stood in\n",
        "the broad entrance and stared inside. Sunlight streamed in through gaps in the walls and roof, making\n",
        "the interior a dim weave of light and shadow. Grasping his sword firmly, Conan entered, with the\n",
        "slouching gait of a hunting panther, sunken head and noiseless feet. Olivia tiptoed after him.\n",
        "Once within, Conan grunted in surprize, and Olivia stifled a scream.\n",
        "\"Look! Oh, look!\"\n",
        "\"I see,\" he answered. \"Nothing to fear. They are statues.\"\n",
        "\"But how life-like--and how evil!\" she whispered, drawing close to him.\n",
        "They stood in a great hall, whose floor was of polished stone, littered with dust and broken stones, which\n",
        "had fallen from the ceiling. Vines, growing between the stones, masked the apertures. The lofty roof, flat\n",
        "and undomed, was upheld by thick columns, marching in rows down the sides of the walls. And in each\n",
        "space between these columns stood a strange figure.\n",
        "They were statues, apparently of iron, black and shining as if continually polished. They were life-sized,\n",
        "depicting tall, lithely powerful men, with cruel hawk-like faces. They were naked, and every swell,\n",
        "depression and contour of joint and sinew was represented with incredible realism. But the most life-like\n",
        "feature was their proud, intolerant faces. These features were not cast in the same mold. Each face\n",
        "possessed its own individual characteristics, though there was a tribal likeness between them all. There\n",
        "was none of the monotonous uniformity of decorative art, in the faces at least.\n",
        "\"They seem to be listening--and waiting!\" whispered the girl uneasily.\n",
        "Conan rang his hilt against one of the images.\n",
        "\"Iron,\" he pronounced. \"But Crom! In what molds were they cast?\"\n",
        "He shook his head and shrugged his massive shoulders in puzzlement.\n",
        "Olivia glanced timidly about the great silent hall. Only the ivy-grown stones, the tendril-clasped pillars,\n",
        "with the dark figures brooding between them, met her gaze. She shifted uneasily and wished to be gone,\n",
        "but the images held a strange fascination for her companion. He examined them in detail, and barbarianlike, tried to break off their limbs. But their material resisted his best efforts. He could neither disfigure\n",
        "nor dislodge from its niche a single image. At last he desisted, swearing in his wonder.\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "162\n",
        "\"What manner of men were these copied from?\" he inquired of the world at large. \"These figures are\n",
        "black, yet they are not like negroes. I have never seen their like.\"\n",
        "\"Let us go into the sunlight,\" urged Olivia, and he nodded, with a baffled glance at the brooding shapes\n",
        "along the walls.\n",
        "So they passed out of the dusky hall into the clear blaze of the summer sun. She was surprized to note its\n",
        "position in the sky; they had spent more time in the ruins than she had guessed.\n",
        "\"Let us take to the boat again,\" she suggested. \"I am afraid here. It is a strange evil place. We do not know\n",
        "when we may be attacked by whatever cast the rock.\"\n",
        "\"I think we're safe as long as we're not under the trees,\" he answered. \"Come.\"\n",
        "The plateau, whose sides fell away toward the wooded shores on the east, west and south, sloped\n",
        "upward toward the north to abut on a tangle of rocky cliffs, the highest point of the island. Thither Conan\n",
        "took his way, suiting his long stride to his companion's gait. From time to time his glance rested\n",
        "inscrutably upon her, and she was aware of it.\n",
        "They reached the northern extremity of the plateau, and stood gazing up the steep pitch of the cliffs.\n",
        "Trees grew thickly along the rim of the plateau east and west of the cliffs, and clung to the precipitous\n",
        "incline. Conan glanced at these trees suspiciously, but he began the ascent, helping his companion on the\n",
        "climb. The slope was not sheer, and was broken by ledges and boulders. The Cimmerian, born in a hill\n",
        "country, could have run up it like a cat, but Olivia found the going difficult. Again and again she felt\n",
        "herself lifted lightly off her feet and over some obstacle that would have taxed her strength to surmount,\n",
        "and her wonder grew at the sheer physical power of the man. She no longer found his touch repugnant.\n",
        "There was a promise of protection in his iron clasp.\n",
        "At last they stood on the ultimate pinnacle, their hair stirring in the sea wind. From their feet the cliffs fell\n",
        "away sheerly three or four hundred feet to a narrow tangle of woodlands bordering the beach. Looking\n",
        "southward they saw the whole island lying like a great oval mirror, its bevelled edges sloping down\n",
        "swiftly into a rim of green, except where it broke in the pitch of the cliffs. As far as they could see, on all\n",
        "sides stretched the blue waters, still, placid, fading into dreamy hazes of distance.\n",
        "\"The sea is still,\" sighed Olivia. \"Why should we not take up our journey again?\"\n",
        "Conan, poised like a bronze statue on the cliffs, pointed northward. Straining her eyes, Olivia saw a white\n",
        "fleck that seemed to hang suspended in the aching haze.\n",
        "\"What is it?\"\n",
        "\"A sail.\"\n",
        "\"Hyrkanians?\"\n",
        "\"Who can tell, at this distance?\"\n",
        "\"They will anchor here--search the island for us!\" she cried in quick panic.\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "163\n",
        "\"I doubt it. They come from the north, so they can not be searching for us. They may stop for some other\n",
        "reason, in which case we'll have to hide as best we can. But I believe it's either pirate, or an Hyrkanian\n",
        "galley returning from some northern raid. In the latter case they are not likely to anchor here. But we can't\n",
        "put to sea until they've gone out of sight, for they're coming from the direction in which we must go.\n",
        "Doubtless they'll pass the island tonight, and at dawn we can go on our way.\"\n",
        "\"Then we must spend the night here?\" she shivered.\n",
        "\"It's safest.\"\n",
        "\"Then let us sleep here, on the crags,\" she urged.\n",
        "He shook his head, glancing at the stunted trees, at the marching woods below, a green mass which\n",
        "seemed to send out tendrils straggling up the sides of the cliffs.\n",
        "\"Here are too many trees. We'll sleep in the ruins.\"\n",
        "She cried out in protest.\n",
        "\"Nothing will harm you there,\" he soothed. \"Whatever threw the stone at us did not follow us out of the\n",
        "woods. There was nothing to show that any wild thing lairs in the ruins. Besides, you are soft-skinned,\n",
        "and used to shelter and dainties. I could sleep naked in the snow and feel no discomfort, but the dew\n",
        "would give you cramps, were we to sleep in the open.\"\n",
        "Olivia helplessly acquiesced, and they descended the cliffs, crossed the plateau and once more\n",
        "approached the gloomy, age-haunted ruins. By this time the sun was sinking below the plateau rim. They\n",
        "had found fruit in the trees near the cliffs, and these formed their supper, both food and drink.\n",
        "The southern night swept down quickly, littering the dark blue sky with great white stars, and Conan\n",
        "entered the shadowy ruins, drawing the reluctant Olivia after him. She shivered at the sight of those tense\n",
        "black shadows in their niches along the walls. In the darkness that the starlight only faintly touched, she\n",
        "could not make out their outlines; she could only sense their attitude of waiting--waiting as they had\n",
        "waited for untold centuries.\n",
        "Conan had brought a great armful of tender branches, well leafed. These he heaped to make a couch for\n",
        "her, and she lay upon it, with a curious sensation as of one lying down to sleep in a serpent's lair.\n",
        "Whatever her forebodings, Conan did not share them. The Cimmerian sat down near her, his back\n",
        "against a pillar, his sword across his knees. His eyes gleamed like a panther's in the dusk.\n",
        "\"Sleep, girl,\" said he. \"My slumber is light as a wolf's. Nothing can enter this hall without awaking me.\"\n",
        "Olivia did not reply. From her bed of leaves she watched the immobile figure, indistinct in the soft\n",
        "darkness. How strange, to move in fellowship with a barbarian, to be cared for and protected by one of a\n",
        "race, tales of which had frightened her as a child! He came of a people bloody, grim and ferocious. His\n",
        "kinship to the wild was apparent in his every action; it burned in his smoldering eyes. Yet he had not\n",
        "harmed her, and her worst oppressor had been a man the world called civilized. As a delicious languor\n",
        "stole over her relaxing limbs and she sank into foamy billows of slumber, her last waking thought was a\n",
        "drowsy recollection of the firm touch of Conan's fingers on her soft flesh.\n",

        "\n",
        "Olivia dreamed, and through her dreams crawled a suggestion of lurking evil, like a black serpent\n",
        "writhing through flower gardens. Her dreams were fragmentary and colorful, exotic shards of a broken,\n",
        "unknown pattern, until they crystalized into a scene of horror and madness, etched against a background\n",
        "of cyclopean stones and pillars.\n",
        "She saw a great hall, whose lofty ceiling was upheld by stone columns marching in even rows along the\n",
        "massive walls. Among these pillars fluttered great green and scarlet parrots, and the hall was thronged\n",
        "with black-skinned, hawk-faced warriors. They were not negroes. Neither they nor their garments nor\n",
        "weapons resembled anything of the world the dreamer knew.\n",
        "They were pressing about one bound to a pillar: a slender white-skinned youth, with a cluster of golden\n",
        "curls about his alabaster brow. His beauty was not altogether human--like the dream of a god, chiseled\n",
        "out of living marble.\n",
        "The black warriors laughed at him, jeered and taunted in a strange tongue. The lithe naked form writhed\n",
        "beneath their cruel hands. Blood trickled down the ivory thighs to spatter on the polished floor. The\n",
        "screams of the victim echoed through the hall; then lifting his head toward the ceiling and the skies\n",
        "beyond, he cried out a name in an awful voice. A dagger in an ebon hand cut short his cry, and the\n",
        "golden head rolled on the ivory breast.\n",
        "As if in answer to that desperate cry, there was a rolling thunder as of celestial chariot-wheels, and a\n",
        "figure stood before the slayers, as if materialized out of empty air. The form was of a man, but no mortal\n",
        "man ever wore such an aspect of inhuman beauty. There was an unmistakable resemblance between him\n",
        "and the youth who dropped lifeless in his chains, but the alloy of humanity that softened the godliness of\n",
        "the youth was lacking in the features of the stranger, awful and immobile in their beauty.\n",
        "The blacks shrank back before him, their eyes slits of fire. Lifting a hand, he spoke, and his tones echoed\n",
        "through the silent halls in deep rich waves of sound. Like men in a trance the black warriors fell back\n",
        "until they were ranged along the walls in regular lines. Then from the stranger's chiseled lips rang a\n",
        "terrible invocation and command: \"Yagkoolan yok tha, xuthalla!\"\n",
        "At the blast of that awful cry, the black figures stiffened and froze. Over their limbs crept a curious\n",
        "rigidity, an unnatural petrification. The stranger touched the limp body of the youth, and the chains fell\n",
        "away from it. He lifted the corpse in his arms; then ere he turned away, his tranquil gaze swept again\n",
        "over the silent rows of ebony figures, and he pointed to the moon, which gleamed in through the\n",
        "casements. And they understood, those tense, waiting statues that had been men . . .\n",
        "Olivia awoke, starting up on her couch of branches, a cold sweat beading her skin. Her heart pounded\n",
        "loud in the silence. She glanced wildly about. Conan slept against his pillar, his head fallen upon his\n",
        "massive breast. The silvery radiance of the late moon crept through the gaping roof, throwing long white\n",
        "lines along the dusty floor. She could see the images dimly, black, tense--waiting. Fighting down a rising\n",
        "hysteria, she saw the moonbeams rest lightly on the pillars and the shapes between.\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "165\n",
        "What was that? A tremor among the shadows where the moonlight fell. A paralysis of horror gripped her,\n",
        "for where there should have been the immobility of death, there was movement: a slow twitching, a\n",
        "flexing and writhing of ebon limbs--an awful scream burst from her lips as she broke the bonds that held\n",
        "her mute and motionless. At her shriek Conan shot erect, teeth gleaming, sword lifted.\n",
        "\"The statues! The statues!--Oh my God, the statues are coming to life!\"\n",
        "And with the cry she sprang through a crevice in the wall, burst madly through the hindering vines, and\n",
        "ran, ran, ran blind, screaming, witless--until a grasp on her arm brought her up short and she shrieked\n",
        "and fought against the arms that caught her, until a familiar voice penetrated the mists of her terror, and\n",
        "she saw Conan's face, a mask of bewilderment in the moonlight.\n",
        "\"What in Crom's name, girl? Did you have a nightmare?\" His voice sounded strange and far away. With a\n",
        "sobbing gasp she threw her arms about his thick neck and clung to him convulsively, crying in panting\n",
        "catches.\n",
        "\"Where are they? Did they follow us?\"\n",
        "\"Nobody followed us,\" he answered.\n",
        "She sat up, still clinging to him, and looked fearfully about. Her blind flight had carried her to the\n",
        "southern edge of the plateau. Just below them was the slope, its foot masked in the thick shadows of the\n",
        "woods. Behind them she saw the ruins looming in the high-swinging moon.\n",
        "\"Did you not see them?--The statues, moving, lifting their hands, their eyes glaring in the shadows?\"\n",
        "\"I saw nothing,\" answered the barbarian uneasily. \"I slept more soundly than usual, because it has been\n",
        "so long since I have slumbered the night through; yet I don't think anything could have entered the hall\n",
        "without waking me.\"\n",
        "\"Nothing entered,\" a laugh of hysteria escaped her. \"It was something there already. Ah, Mitra, we lay\n",
        "down to sleep among them, like sheep making their bed in the shambles!\"\n",
        "\"What are you talking about?\" he demanded. \"I woke at your cry, but before I had time to look about me,\n",
        "I saw you rush out through the crack in the wall. I pursued you, lest you come to harm. I thought you\n",
        "had a nightmare.\"\n",
        "\"So I did!\" she shivered. \"But the reality was more grisly than the dream. Listen!\" And she narrated all\n",
        "that she had dreamed and thought to see.\n",
        "Conan listened attentively. The natural skepticism of the sophisticated man was not his. His mythology\n",
        "contained ghouls, goblins, and necromancers. After she had finished, he sat silent, absently toying with\n",
        "his sword.\n",
        "\"The youth they tortured was like the tall man who came?\" he asked at last.\n",
        "\"As like as son to father,\" she answered, and hesitantly: \"If the mind could conceive of the offspring of a\n",
        "union of divinity with humanity, it would picture that youth. The gods of old times mated sometimes\n",
        "with mortal women, our legends tell us.\"\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "166\n",
        "\"What gods?\" he muttered.\n",
        "\"The nameless, forgotten ones. Who knows? They have gone back into the still waters of the lakes, the\n",
        "quiet hearts of the hills, the gulfs beyond the stars. Gods are no more stable than men.\"\n",
        "\"But if these shapes were men, blasted into iron images by some god or devil, how can they come to life?\"\n",
        "\"There is witchcraft in the moon,\" she shuddered. \"He pointed at the moon; while the moon shines on\n",
        "them, they live. So I believe.\"\n",
        "\"But we were not pursued,\" muttered Conan, glancing toward the brooding ruins. \"You might have\n",
        "dreamed they moved. I am of a mind to return and see.\"\n",
        "\"No, no!\" she cried, clutching him desperately. \"Perhaps the spell upon them holds them in the hall. Do\n",
        "not go back! They will rend you limb from limb! Oh, Conan, let us go into our boat and flee this awful\n",
        "island! Surely the Hyrkanian ship has passed us now! Let us go!\"\n",
        "So frantic was her pleading that Conan was impressed. His curiosity in regard to the images was\n",
        "balanced by his superstition. Foes of flesh and blood he did not fear, however great the odds, but any hint\n",
        "of the supernatural roused all the dim monstrous instincts of fear that are the heritage of the barbarian.\n",
        "He took the girl's hand and they went down the slope and plunged into the dense woods, where the\n",
        "leaves whispered, and nameless night-birds murmured drowsily. Under the trees the shadows clustered\n",
        "thick, and Conan swerved to avoid the denser patches. His eyes roved continuously from side to side,\n",
        "and often flitted into the branches above them. He went quickly yet warily, his arm girdling the girl's\n",
        "waist so strongly that she felt as if she were being carried rather than guided. Neither spoke. The only\n",
        "sound was the girl's quick nervous panting, the rustle of her small feet in the grass. So they came through\n",
        "the trees to the edge of the water, shimmering like molten silver in the moonlight.\n",
        "\"We should have brought fruit for food,\" muttered Conan; \"but doubtless we'll find other islands. As well\n",
        "leave now as later; it's but a few hours till dawn--\"\n",
        "His voice trailed away. The painter was still made fast to the looping root. But at the other end was only a\n",
        "smashed and shattered ruin, half submerged in the shallow water.\n",
        "A stifled cry escaped Olivia. Conan wheeled and faced the dense shadows, a crouching image of menace.\n",
        "The noise of the night-birds was suddenly silent. A brooding stillness reigned over the woods. No breeze\n",
        "moved the branches, yet somewhere the leaves stirred faintly.\n",
        "Quick as a great cat, Conan caught up Olivia and ran. Through the shadows he raced like a phantom,\n",
        "while somewhere above and behind them sounded a curious rushing among the leaves, that implacably\n",
        "drew closer and closer. Then the moonlight burst full upon their faces, and they were speeding up the\n",
        "slope of the plateau.\n",
        "At the crest Conan laid Olivia down, and turned to glare back at the gulf of shadows they had just quitted.\n",
        "The leaves shook in a sudden breeze; that was all. He shook his mane with an angry growl. Olivia crept\n",
        "to his feet like a frightened child. Her eyes looked up at him, dark wells of horror.\n",
        "\"What are we to do, Conan?\" she whispered.\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "167\n",
        "He looked at the ruins, stared again into the woods below.\n",
        "\"We'll go to the cliffs,\" he declared, lifting her to her feet. \"Tomorrow I'll make a raft, and we'll trust our\n",
        "luck to the sea again.\"\n",
        "\"It was not--not they that destroyed our boat?\" It was half question, half assertion.\n",
        "He shook his head, grimly taciturn.\n",
        "Every step of the way across that moon-haunted plateau was a sweating terror for Olivia, but no black\n",
        "shapes stole subtly from the looming ruins, and at last they reached the foot of the crags, which rose stark\n",
        "and gloomily majestic above them. There Conan halted in some uncertainty, at last selecting a place\n",
        "sheltered by a broad ledge, nowhere near any trees.\n",
        "\"Lie down and sleep if you can, Olivia,\" he said. \"I'll keep watch.\"\n",
        "But no sleep came to Olivia, and she lay watching the distant ruins and the wooded rim until the stars\n",
        "paled, the east whitened, and dawn in rose and gold struck fire from the dew on the grassblades.\n",
        "She rose stiffly, her mind reverting to all the happenings of the night. In the morning light some of its\n",
        "terrors seemed like figments of an overwrought imagination. Conan strode over to her, and his words\n",
        "electrified her.\n",
        "\"Just before dawn I heard the creak of timbers and the rasp and clack of cordage and oars. A ship has put\n",
        "in and anchored at the beach not far away--probably the ship whose sail we saw yesterday. We'll go up\n",
        "the cliffs and spy on her.\"\n",
        "Up they went, and lying on their bellies among the boulders, saw a painted mast jutting up beyond the\n",
        "trees to the west.\n",
        "\"An Hyrkanian craft, from the cut of her rigging,\" muttered Conan. \"I wonder if the crew--\"\n",
        "A distant medley of voices reached their ears, and creeping to the southern edge of the cliffs, they saw a\n",
        "molly horde emerge from the fringe of trees along the western rim of the plateau, and stand there a space\n",
        "in debate. There was much flourishing of arms, brandishing of swords, and loud rough argument. Then\n",
        "the whole band started across the plateau toward the ruins, at a slant that would take them close by the\n",
        "foot of the cliffs.\n",
        "\"Pirates!\" whispered Conan, a grim smile on his thin lips. \"It's an Hyrkanian galley they've captured.\n",
        "Here--crawl among these rocks.\n",
        "\"Don't show yourself unless I call to you,\" he instructed, having secreted her to his satisfaction among a\n",
        "tangle of boulders along the crest of the cliffs. \"I'm going to meet these dogs. If I succeed in my plan, all\n",
        "will be well, and we'll sail away with them. If I don't succeed--well, hide yourself in the rocks until they're\n",
        "gone, for no devils on this island are as cruel as these sea-wolves.\"\n",
        "And tearing himself from her reluctant grasp, he swung quickly down the cliffs.\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "168\n",
        "Looking fearfully from her eyrie, Olivia saw the band had neared the foot of the cliffs. Even as she looked,\n",
        "Conan stepped out from among the boulders and faced them, sword in hand. They gave back with yells\n",
        "of menace and surprize; then halted uncertainly to glare at this figure which had appeared so suddenly\n",
        "from the rocks. There were some seventy of them, a wild horde made up of men from many nations:\n",
        "Kothians, Zamorians, Brythunians, Corinthians, Shemites. Their features reflected the wildness of their\n",
        "natures. Many bore the scars of the lash or the branding-iron. There were cropped ears, slit noses, gaping\n",
        "eye-sockets, stumps of wrists--marks of the hangman as well as scars of battle. Most of them were half\n",
        "naked, but the garments they wore were fine; gold-braided jackets, satin girdles, silken breeches, tattered,\n",
        "stained with tar and blood, vied with pieces of silver-chased armor. Jewels glittered in nose-rings and earrings, and in the hilts of their daggers.\n",
        "Over against this bizarre mob stood the tall Cimmerian in strong contrast with his hard bronzed limbs\n",
        "and clean-cut vital features.\n",
        "\"Who are you?\" they roared.\n",
        "\"Conan the Cimmerian!\" His voice was like the deep challenge of a lion. \"One of the Free Companions. I\n",
        "mean to try my luck with the Red Brotherhood. Who's your chief?\"\n",
        "\"I, by Ishtar!\" bellowed a bull-like voice, as a huge figure swaggered forward: a giant, naked to the waist,\n",
        "where his capacious belly was girdled by a wide sash that upheld voluminous silken pantaloons. His\n",
        "head was shaven except for a scalplock, his mustaches dropped over a rat-trap mouth. Green Shemitish\n",
        "slippers with upturned toes were on his feet, a long straight sword in his hand.\n",
        "Conan stared and glared.\n",
        "\"Sergius of Khrosha, by Crom!\"\n",
        "\"Aye, by Ishtar!\" boomed the giant, his small black eyes glittering with hate. \"Did you think I had forgot?\n",
        "Ha! Sergius never forgets an enemy. Now I'll hang you up by the heels and skin you alive. At him, lads!\"\n",
        "\"Aye, send your dogs at me, big-belly,\" sneered Conan with bitter scorn, \"You were always a coward, you\n",
        "Kothic cur.\"\n",
        "\"Coward! To me?\" The broad face turned black with passion. \"On guard, you northern dog! I'll cut out\n",
        "your heart!\"\n",
        "In an instant the pirates had formed a circle about the rivals, their eyes blazing, their breath sucking\n",
        "between their teeth in bloodthirsty enjoyment. High up among the crags Olivia watched, sinking her nails\n",
        "into her palms in her painful excitement.\n",
        "Without formality the combatants engaged, Sergius coming in with a rush, quick on his feet as a giant cat,\n",
        "for all his bulk. Curses hissed between his clenched teeth as he lustily swung and parried. Conan fought\n",
        "in silence, his eyes slits of blue bale-fire.\n",
        "The Kothian ceased his oaths to save his breath. The only sounds were the quick scuff of feet on the\n",
        "sward, the panting of the pirate, the ring and clash of steel. The swords flashed like white fire in the early\n",
        "sun, wheeling and circling. They seemed to recoil from each other's contact, then leap together again\n",
        "instantly. Sergius was giving back; only his superlative skill had saved him thus far from the blinding \n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "169\n",
        "speed of the Cimmerian's onslaught. A louder clash of steel, a sliding rasp, a choking cry from the pirate\n",
        "horde, a fierce yell split the morning as Conan's sword plunged through their captain's massive body.\n",
        "The point quivered an instant from between Sergius's shoulders, a hand's breadth of white fire in the\n",
        "sunlight; then the Cimmerian wrenched back his steel and the pirate chief fell heavily, face down, and lay\n",
        "in a widening pool of blood, his broad hands twitching for an instant.\n",
        "Conan wheeled toward the gaping corsairs.\n",
        "\"Well, you dogs!\" he roared. \"I've sent your chief to hell. What says the law of the Red Brotherhood?\"\n",
        "Before any could answer, a rat-faced Brythunian, standing behind his fellows, whirled a sling swiftly and\n",
        "deadly. Straight as an arrow sped the stone to its mark, and Conan reeled and fell as a tall tree falls to the\n",
        "woodsman's ax. Up on the cliff Olivia caught at the boulders for support. The scene swam dizzily before\n",
        "her eyes; all she could see was the Cimmerian lying limply on the sward, blood oozing from his head.\n",
        "The rat-faced one yelped in triumph and ran to stab the prostrate man, but a lean Corinthian thrust him\n",
        "back.\n",
        "\"What, Aratus, would you break the law of the Brotherhood, you dog?\"\n",
        "\"No law is broken,\" snarled the Brythunian.\n",
        "\"No law? Why, you dog, this man you have just struck down is by just rights our captain!\"\n",
        "\"Nay!\" shouted Aratus. \"He was not of our band, but an outsider. He had not been admitted to fellowship.\n",
        "Slaying Sergius does not make him captain, as would have been the case had one of us killed him.\"\n",
        "\"But he wished to join us,\" retorted the Corinthian. \"He said so.\"\n",
        "At that a great clamor arose, some siding with Aratus, some with the Corinthian, whom they called\n",
        "Ivanos. Oaths flew thick, challenges were passed, hands fumbled at sword-hilts.\n",
        "At last a Shemite spoke up above the clamor: \"Why do you argue over a dead man?\"\n",
        "\"He's not dead,\" answered the Corinthian, rising from beside the prostrate Cimmerian. \"It was a glancing\n",
        "blow; he's only stunned.\"\n",
        "At that the clamor rose anew, Aratus trying to get at the senseless man and Ivanos finally bestriding him,\n",
        "sword in hand, and defying all and sundry. Olivia sensed that it was not so much in defense of Conan\n",
        "that the Corinthian took his stand, but in opposition to Aratus. Evidently these men had been Sergius's\n",
        "lieutenants, and there was no love lost between them. After more arguments, it was decided to bind\n",
        "Conan and take him along with them, his fate to be voted on later.\n",
        "The Cimmerian, who was beginning to regain consciousness, was bound with leather girdles, and then\n",
        "four pirates lifted him, and with many complaints and curses, carried him along with the band, which\n",
        "took up its journey across the plateau once more. The body of Sergius was left where it had fallen; a\n",
        "sprawling, unlovely shape on the sun-washed sward.\n",
        "Shadows in the Moonlight\n",
        "170\n",
        "Up among the rocks, Olivia lay stunned by the disaster. She was incapable of speech or action, and could\n",
        "only lie there and stare with horrified eyes as the brutal horde dragged her protector away.\n",
        "How long she lay there, she did not know. Across the plateau she saw the pirates reach the ruins and\n",

        "horror at the bronzed figure facing the monster, she sensed a kinship in the antagonists that was almost\n",

        "Conan's action was a blur of speed Olivia's eye could not follow. She only saw that he evaded that deadly\n",
        "grasp, and his sword, flashing like a jet of white lightning, sheared through one of those massive arms\n",
        "between shoulder and elbow. A great spout of blood deluged the sward as the severed member fell,\n",
        "twitching horribly, but even as the sword bit through, the other malformed hand locked in Conan's black\n",

        "Only the iron neck muscles of the Cimmerian saved him from a broken neck that instant. His left hand\n",
        "darted out to clamp on the beast's squat throat, his left knee was jammed hard against the brute's hairy\n",

        "paralyzed girl.\n",
        "The ape maintained his grasp in Conan's hair, dragging him toward the tusks that glistened in the\n",

        "great, to have driven him to attack us finally in the open. What--\"\n",

        "accompanied by a ringing of steel, the sounds were of massacre rather than battle.\n",
        "Conan stood frozen, the girl clinging to him in a frenzy of terror. The clamor rose to a crescendo of\n",
        "madness, and then the Cimmerian turned and went swiftly toward the rim of the plateau, with its fringe\n",
        "of moon-limned trees. Olivia's legs were trembling so that she could not walk; so he carried her, and her\n",
        "heart calmed its frantic pounding as she nestled into his cradling arms.\n",
        "They passed under the shadowy forest, but the clusters of blackness held no terrors, the rifts of silver\n",

        "up the street came the shout and clatter of pursuit, but the horseman did not look back. He swept out\n",
        "onto the wharfs and jerked the plunging stallion back on its haunches at the very lip of the pier. Seamen\n",
        "gaped up at him, as they stood to the sweep and striped sail of a high-prowed, broad-waisted galley. The\n",
        "master, sturdy and black-bearded, stood in the bows, easing her away from the piles with a boat-hook.\n",
        "He yelled angrily as the horseman sprang from the saddle and with a long leap landed squarely on the\n",
        "mid-deck.\n",
        "\"Who invited you aboard?\"\n",
        "\"Get under way!\" roared the intruder with a fierce gesture that spattered red drops from his broadsword.\n",
        "\"But we're bound for the coasts of Kush!\" expostulated the master.\n",
        "\"Then I'm for Kush! Push off, I tell you!\" The other cast a quick glance up the street, along which a squad\n",
        "of horsemen were galloping; far behind them toiled a group of archers, crossbows on their shoulders.\n",
        "\"Can you pay for your passage?\" demanded the master.\n",
        "\"I pay my way with steel!\" roared the man in armor, brandishing the great sword that glittered bluely in\n",
        "the sun. \"By Crom, yin, if you don't get under way, I'll drench this galley in the blood of its crew!\"\n",
        "The shipmaster was a good judge of men. One glance at the irk-scarred face of the swordsman, hardened\n",
        "with passion, and he shouted a quick order, thrusting strongly against the piles. The galley wallowed out \n",
        "Queen of the Back Coast\n",
        "178\n",
        "into clear water, the oars began to clack rhythmically; then a puff of wind filled the shimmering sail, the\n",
        "light ship heeled to the gust, then took her course like a swan, gathering headway as she skimmed along.\n",
        "On the wharfs the riders were shaking their swords and shouting threats and commands that the ship put\n",
        "about, and yelling for the bowmen to hasten before the craft was out of arbalest range.\n",
        "\"Let them rave,\" grinned the swordsman hardily. \"Do you keep her on her course, master steersman.\"\n",
        "The master descended from the small deck between the bows, made his way between the rows of\n",
        "oarsmen, and mounted the mid-deck. The stranger stood there with his back to the mast, eyes narrowed\n",
        "alertly, sword ready. The shipman eyed him steadily, careful not to make any move toward the long knife\n",
        "in his belt. He saw a tall powerfully built figure in a black scale-mail hauberk, burnished greaves and a\n",
        "blue-steel helmet from which jutted bull's horns highly polished. From the mailed shoulders fell the\n",
        "scarlet cloak, blowing in the sea-wind. A broad shagreen belt with a golden buckle held the scabbard of\n",
        "the broadsword he bore. Under the horned helmet a square-cut black mane contrasted with smoldering\n",
        "blue eyes.\n",
        "\"If we must travel together,\" said the master, \"we may as well be at peace with each other. My name is\n",
        "Tito, licensed mastershipman of the ports of Argos. I am bound for Kush, to trade beads and silks and\n",
        "sugar and brass-hilted swords to the black kings for ivory, copra, copper ore, slaves and pearls.\"\n",
        "The swordsman glanced back at the rapidly receding docks, where the figures still gesticulated helplessly,\n",
        "evidently having trouble in finding a boat swift enough to overhaul the fast-sailing galley.\n",
        "\"I am Conan, a Cimmerian,\" he answered. \"I came into Argos seeking employment, but with no wars\n",
        "forward, there was nothing to which I might turn my hand.\"\n",
        "\"Why do the guardsman pursue you?\" asked Tito. \"Not that it's any of my business, but I thought\n",
        "perhaps--\"\n",
        "\"I've nothing to conceal,\" replied the Cimmerian. \"By Crom, though I've spent considerable time among\n",
        "you civilized peoples, your ways are still beyond my comprehension.\n",
        "\"Well, last night in a tavern, a captain in the king's guard offered violence to the sweetheart of a young\n",
        "soldier, who naturally ran him through. But it seems there is some cursed law against killing guardsmen,\n",
        "and the boy and his girl fled away. It was bruited about that I was seen with them, and so today I was\n",
        "haled into court, and a judge asked me where the lad had gone. I replied that since he was a friend of\n",
        "mine, I could not betray him. Then the court waxed wrath, and the judge talked a great deal about my\n",
        "duty to the state, and society, and other things I did not understand, and bade me tell where my friend\n",
        "had flown. By this time I was becoming wrathful myself, for I had explained my position.\n",
        "\"But I choked my ire and held my peace, and the judge squalled that I had shown contempt for the court,\n",
        "and that I should be hurled into a dungeon to rot until I betrayed my friend. So then, seeing they were all\n",
        "mad, I drew my sword and cleft the judge's skull; then I cut my way out of the court, and seeing the high\n",
        "constable's stallion tied near by, I rode for the wharfs, where I thought to find a ship bound for foreign\n",
        "parts.\"\n",
        "Queen of the Back Coast\n",
        "179\n",
        "\"Well,\" said Tito hardily, \"the courts have fleeced me too often in suits with rich merchants for me to owe\n",
        "them any love. I'll have questions to answer if I ever anchor in that port again, but I can prove I acted\n",
        "under compulsion. You may as well put up your sword. We're peaceable sailors, and have nothing\n",
        "against you. Besides, it's as well to have a fighting-man like yourself on board. Come up to the poop-deck\n",
        "and we'll have a tankard of ale.\"\n",
        "\"Good enough,\" readily responded the Cimmerian, sheathing his sword.\n",
        "The Argus was a small sturdy ship, typical of those trading-craft which ply between the ports of Zingara\n",
        "and Argos and the southern coasts, hugging the shoreline and seldom venturing far into the open ocean.\n",
        "It was high of stern, with a tall curving prow; broad in the waist, sloping beautifully to stem and stern. It\n",
        "was guided by the long sweep from the poop, and propulsion was furnished mainly by the broad striped\n",
        "silk sail, aided by a jibsail. The oars were for use in tacking out of creeks and bays, and during calms.\n",
        "There were ten to the side, five fore and five aft of the small mid-deck. The most precious part of the\n",
        "cargo was lashed under this deck, and under the fore-deck. The men slept on deck or between the rowers'\n",
        "benches, protected in bad weather by canopies. With twenty men at the oars, three at the sweep, and the\n",
        "shipmaster, the crew was complete.\n",
        "So the Argus pushed steadily southward, with consistently fair weather. The sun beat down from day to\n",
        "day with fiercer heat, and the canopies were run up--striped silken cloths that matched the shimmering\n",
        "sail and the shining goldwork on the prow and along the gunwales.\n",
        "They sighted the coast of Shem--long rolling meadowlands with the white crowns of the towers of cities\n",
        "in the distance, and horsemen with blue-black beards and hooked noses, who sat their steeds along the\n",
        "shore and eyed the galley with suspicion. She did not put in; there was scant profit in trade with the sons\n",
        "of Shem.\n",
        "Nor did master Tito pull into the broad bay where the Styx river emptied its gigantic flood into the ocean,\n",
        "and the massive black castles of Khemi loomed over the blue waters. Ships did not put unasked into this\n",
        "port, where dusky sorcerers wove awful spells in the murk of sacrificial smoke mounting eternally from\n",
        "blood-stained altars where naked women screamed, and where Set, the Old Serpent, arch-demon of the\n",
        "Hyborians but god of the Stygians, was said to writhe his shining coils among his worshippers.\n",
        "Master Tito gave that dreamy glass-floored bay a wide berth, even when a serpent-prowed gondola shot\n",
        "from behind a castellated point of land, and naked dusky women, with great red blossoms in their hair,\n",
        "stood and called to his sailors, and posed and postured brazenly.\n",
        "Now no more shining towers rose inland. They had passed the southern borders of Stygia and were\n",
        "cruising along the coasts of Kush. The sea and the ways of the sea were neverending mysteries to Conan,\n",
        "whose homeland was among the high hills of the northern uplands. The wanderer was no less of interest\n",
        "to the sturdy seamen, few of whom had ever seen one of his race.\n",
        "They were characteristic Argosean sailors, short and stockily built. Conan towered above them, and no\n",
        "two of them could match his strength. They were hardy and robust, but his was the endurance and\n",
        "vitality of a wolf, his thews steeled and his nerves whetted by the hardness of his life in the world's\n",
        "wastelands. He was quick to laugh, quick and terrible in his wrath. He was a valiant trencherman, and\n",
        "strong drink was a passion and a weakness with him. Naive as a child in many ways, unfamiliar with the \n",
        "Queen of the Back Coast\n",
        "180\n",
        "sophistry of civilization, he was naturally intelligent, jealous of his rights, and dangerous as a hungry\n",
        "tiger. Young in years, he was hardened in warfare and wandering, and his sojourns in many lands were\n",
        "evident in his apparel. His horned helmet was such as was worn by the golden-haired AEsir of Nordheim;\n",
        "his hauberk and greaves were of the finest workmanship of Koth; the fine ring-mail which sheathed his\n",
        "arms and legs was of Nemedia; the blade at his girdle was a great Aquilonian broadsword; and his\n",
        "gorgeous scarlet cloak could have been spun nowhere but in Ophir.\n",
        "So they beat southward, and master Tito began to look for the high-walled villages of the black people.\n",
        "But they found only smoking ruins on the shore of a bay, littered with naked black bodies. Tito swore.\n",
        "\"I had good trade here, aforetime. This is the work of pirates.\"\n",
        "\"And if we meet them?\" Conan loosened his great blade in its scabbard.\n",
        "\"Mine is no warship. We run, not fight. Yet if it came to a pinch, we have beaten off reavers before, and\n",
        "might do it again; unless it were Belit's Tigress.\"\n",
        "\"Who is Belit?\"\n",
        "\"The wildest she-devil unhanged. Unless I read the signs awrong, it was her butchers who destroyed that\n",
        "village on the bay. May I some day see her dangling from the yard-arm! She is called the queen of the\n",
        "black coast. She is a Shemite woman, who leads black raiders. They harry the shipping and have sent\n",
        "many a good tradesman to the bottom.\"\n",
        "From under the poop-deck Tito brought out quilted jerkins, steel caps, bows and arrows.\n",
        "\"Little use to resist if we're run down,\" he grunted. \"But it rasps the soul to give up life without a\n",
        "struggle.\"\n",
        "It was just at sunrise when the lookout shouted a warning. Around the long point of an island off the\n",
        "starboard bow glided a long lethal shape, a slender serpentine galley, with a raised deck that ran from\n",
        "stem to stern. Forty oars on each side drove her swiftly through the water, and the low rail swarmed with\n",
        "naked blacks that chanted and clashed spears on oval shields. From the masthead floated a long crimson\n",
        "pennon.\n",
        "\"Belit!\" yelled Tito, paling. \"Yare! Put her about! Into that creek-mouth! If we can beach her before they\n",
        "run us down, we have a chance to escape with our lives!\"\n",
        "So, veering sharply, the Argus ran for the line of surf that boomed along the palm-fringed shore, Tito\n",
        "striding back and forth, exhorting the panting rowers to greater efforts. The master's black beard bristled,\n",
        "his eyes glared.\n",
        "\"Give me a bow,\" requested Conan. \"It's not my idea of a manly weapon, but I learned archery among the\n",
        "Hyrkanians, and it will go hard if I can't feather a man or so on yonder deck.\"\n",
        "Standing on the poop, he watched the serpent-like ship skimming lightly over the waters, and landsman\n",
        "though he was, it was evident to him that the Argus would never win that race. Already arrows, arching\n",
        "from the pirate's deck, were falling with a hiss into the sea, not twenty paces astern.\n",
        "Queen of the Back Coast\n",
        "181\n",
        "\"We'd best stand to it,\" growled the Cimmerian; \"else we'll all die with shafts in our backs, and not a blow\n",
        "dealt.\"\n",
        "\"Bend to it, dogs!\" roared Tito with a passionate gesture of his brawny fist. The bearded rowers grunted,\n",
        "heaved at the oars, while their muscles coiled and knotted, and sweat started out on their hides. The\n",
        "timbers of the stout little galley creaked and groaned as the men fairly ripped her through the water. The\n",
        "wind had fallen; the sail hung limp. Nearer crept the inexorable raiders, and they were still a good mile\n",
        "from the surf when one of the steersmen fell gagging across a sweep, a long arrow through his neck. Tito\n",
        "sprang to take his place, and Conan, bracing his feet wide on the heaving poop-deck, lifted his bow. He\n",
        "could see the details of the pirate plainly now. The rowers were protected by a line of raised mantelets\n",
        "along the sides, but the warriors dancing on the narrow deck were in full view. These were painted and\n",
        "plumed, and mostly naked, brandishing spears and spotted shields.\n",
        "On the raised platform in the bows stood a slim figure whose white skin glistened in dazzling contrast to\n",
        "the glossy ebon hides about it. Belit, without a doubt. Conan drew the shaft to his ear--then some whim\n",
        "or qualm stayed his hand and sent the arrow through the body of a tall plumed spearman beside her.\n",
        "Hand over hand the pirate galley was overhauling the lighter ship. Arrows fell in a rain about the Argus,\n",
        "and men cried out. All the steersmen were down, pincushioned, and Tito was handling the massive\n",
        "sweep alone, gasping black curses, his braced legs knots of straining thews. Then with a sob he sank\n",
        "down, a long shaft quivering in his sturdy heart. The Argus lost headway and rolled in the swell. The\n",
        "men shouted in confusion, and Conan took command in characteristic fashion.\n",
        "\"Up, lads!\" he roared, loosing with a vicious twang of cord. \"Grab your steel and give these dogs a few\n",
        "knocks before they cut our throats! Useless to bend your backs any more: they'll board us ere we can row\n",
        "another fifty paces!\"\n",
        "In desperation the sailors abandoned their oars and snatched up their weapons. It was valiant, but useless.\n",
        "They had time for one flight of arrows before the pirate was upon them. With no one at the sweep, the\n",
        "Argus rolled broadside, and the steel-baked prow of the raider crashed into her amidships. Grapplingirons crunched into the side. From the lofty gunwales, the black pirates drove down a volley of shafts that\n",
        "tore through the quilted jackets of the doomed sailormen, then sprang down spears in hand to complete\n",
        "the slaughter. On the deck of the pirate lay half a dozen bodies, an earnest of Conan's archery.\n",
        "The fight on the Argus was short and bloody. The stocky sailors, no match for the tall barbarians, were\n",
        "cut down to a man. Elsewhere the battle had taken a peculiar turn. Conan, on the high-pitched poop, was\n",
        "on a level with the pirate's deck. As the steel prow slashed into the Argus, he braced himself and kept his\n",
        "feet under the shock, casting away his bow. A tall corsair, bounding over the rail, was met in midair by\n",
        "the Cimmerian's great sword, which sheared him cleanly through the torso, so that his body fell one way\n",
        "and his legs another. Then, with a burst of fury that left a heap of mangled corpses along the gunwales,\n",
        "Conan was over the rail and on the deck of the Tigress.\n",
        "In an instant he was the center of a hurricane of stabbing spears and lashing clubs. But he moved in a\n",
        "blinding blur of steel. Spears bent on his armor or swished empty air, and his sword sang its death-song.\n",
        "The fighting-madness of his race was upon him, and with a red mist of unreasoning fury wavering before\n",
        "his blazing eyes, he cleft skulls, smashed breasts, severed limbs, ripped out entrails, and littered the deck\n",
        "like a shambles with a ghastly harvest of brains and blood.\n",
        "Queen of the Back Coast\n",
        "182\n",
        "Invulnerable in his armor, his back against the mast, he heaped mangled corpses at his feet until his\n",
        "enemies gave back panting in rage and fear. Then as they lifted their spears to cast them, and he tensed\n",
        "himself to leap and die in the midst of them, a shrill cry froze the lifted arms. They stood like statues, the\n",
        "black giants poised for the spearcasts, the mailed swordsman with his dripping blade.\n",
        "Befit sprang before the blacks, beating down their spears. She turned toward Conan, her bosom heaving,\n",
        "her eyes flashing. Fierce fingers of wonder caught at his heart. She was slender, yet formed like a goddess:\n",
        "at once lithe and voluptuous. Her only garment was a broad silken girdle. Her white ivory limbs and the\n",
        "ivory globes of her breasts drove a beat of fierce passion through the Cimmerian's pulse, even in the\n",
        "panting fury of battle. Her rich black hair, black as a Stygian night, fell in rippling burnished clusters\n",
        "down her supple back. Her dark eyes burned on the Cimmerian.\n",
        "She was untamed as a desert wind, supple and dangerous as a she-panther. She came close to him,\n",
        "heedless of his great blade, dripping with blood of her warriors. Her supple thigh brushed against it, so\n",
        "close she came to the tall warrior. Her red lips parted as she stared up into his somber menacing eyes.\n",
        "\"Who are you?\" she demanded. \"By Ishtar, I have never seen your like, though I have ranged the sea from\n",
        "the coasts of Zingara to the fires of the ultimate south. Whence come you?\"\n",
        "\"From Argos,\" he answered shortly, alert for treachery. Let her slim hand move toward the jeweled\n",
        "dagger in her girdle, and a buffet of his open hand would stretch her senseless on the deck. Yet in his\n",
        "heart he did not fear; he had held too many women, civilized or barbaric, in his iron-thewed arms, not to\n",
        "recognize the light that burned in the eyes of this one.\n",
        "\"You are no soft Hyborian!\" she exclaimed. \"You are fierce and hard as a gray wolf. Those eyes were\n",
        "never dimmed by city lights; those thews were never softened by life amid marble walls.\"\n",
        "\"I am Conan, a Cimmerian,\" he answered.\n",
        "To the people of the exotic climes, the north was a mazy half-mythical realm, peopled with ferocious\n",
        "blue-eyed giants who occasionally descended from their icy fastnesses with torch and sword. Their raids\n",
        "had never taken them as far south as Shem, and this daughter of Shem made no distinction between\n",

        "His eyes swept the blood-stained ranks, seeking expressions of wrath or jealousy. He saw none. The fury\n",

        "It was but the ghost of a city on which they looked when they cleared a jutting jungle-clad point and\n",
        "swung in toward the incurving shore. Weeds and rank river grass grew between the stones of broken\n",

        "stood a massive altar. Belit went swiftly along the ancient floor and stood before it.\n",
        "\"This was the temple of the old ones,\" she said. \"Look--you can see the channels for the blood along the\n",

        "She spread her slim hands helplessly. \"Not even in legendary is this city mentioned. But look at the\n",

        "reptile, the giant blacks braced their feet, grunted and heaved with their huge muscles coiling and\n",
        "straining under their ebon skin. The altar did not come off the ground, but it revolved suddenly on its\n",
        "side. And simultaneously there was a grinding rumble above and the tower came crashing down,\n",
        "covering the four black men with broken masonry.\n",
        "A cry of horror rose from their comrades. Belit's slim fingers dug into Conan's arm-muscles. \"There was\n",
        "no serpent,\" she whispered. \"It was but a ruse to call you away. I feared; the old ones guarded their\n",
        "treasure well. Let us clear away the stones.\"\n",
        "With herculean labor they did so, and lifted out the mangled bodies of the four men. And under them,\n",
        "stained with their blood, the pirates found a crypt carved in the solid stone. The altar, hinged curiously\n",
        "with stone rods and sockets on one side, had served as its lid. And at first glance the crypt seemed\n",
        "brimming with liquid fire, catching the early light with a million blazing facets. Undreamable wealth lay\n",
        "before the eyes of the gaping pirates; diamonds, rubies, bloodstones, sapphires, turquoises, moonstones,\n",
        "opals, emeralds, amethysts, unknown gems that shone like the eyes of evil women. The crypt was filled\n",
        "to the brim with bright stones that the morning sun struck into lambent flame.\n",
        "With a cry Belit dropped to her knees among the bloodstained rubble on the brink and thrust her white\n",
        "arms shoulder-deep into that pool of splendor. She withdrew them, clutching something that brought\n",
        "another cry to her lips--a long string of crimson stones that were like clots of frozen blood strung on a\n",

        "\"The devil-ape has been investigating the ship,\" muttered the blacks uneasily.\n",

        "litter of spears and mantles to bear these jewels--where the devil are you going?\"\n",
        "\"To look to the galley,\" grunted Conan. \"That bat-thing might have knocked a hole in the bottom, for all\n",
        "we know.\"\n",
        "He ran swiftly down the cracked wharf and sprang aboard. A moment's swift examination below decks,\n",
        "and he swore heartily, casting a clouded glance in the direction the bat-being had vanished. He returned\n",
        "hastily to Belit, superintending the plundering of the crypt. She had looped the necklace about her neck,\n",
        "and on her naked white bosom the red clots glimmered darkly. A huge naked black stood crotch-deep in\n",
        "the jewel-brimming crypt, scooping up great handfuls of splendor to pass them to eager hands above.\n",
        "Strings of frozen iridescence hung between his dusky fingers; drops of red fire dripped from his hands,\n",
        "piled high with starlight and rainbow. It was as if a black titan stood straddle-legged in the bright pits of\n",
        "hell, his lifted hands full of stars.\n",
        "\"That flying devil has staved in the water-casks,\" said Conan. \"If we hadn't been so dazed by these stones\n",

        "would break the parley truce. Anyway, we must be prepared for whatever he might attempt.\n",
        "\"Then, shortly after the parley, before he has time to forget all about her, we will send a messenger to him,\n",
        "under a flag of truce, accusing him of stealing the girl and demanding her return. He may kill the\n",
        "messenger, but at least he will think that she has escaped.\n",
        "\"Then we will send a spy--a Yuetishi fisherman will do--to the kozak camp, who will tell Conan that\n",

        "retorted Ghaznavi. \"The chances are all that he will go alone. But we will take care of the other alternative.\n",
        "We will not await him on the island, where we might be trapped ourselves, but among the reeds of a\n",
        "marshy point, which juts out to within a thousand yards of Xapur. If he brings a large force, we'll beat a\n",
        "retreat and think up another plot. If he comes alone or with a small party, we will have him. Depend\n",
        "upon it, he will come, remembering your charming slave's smiles and meaning glances.\"\n",

        "\"You will not die, my rebellious beauty,\" said Jehungir, \"but you will be subjected to a very painful and\n",
        "humiliating experience.\"\n",
        "He clapped his hands, and Octavia palled. This time it was not the Kushite who entered, but a Shemite, a\n",

        "With an inarticulate grunt the Shemite seized Octavia's wrist, and at the grasp of his iron fingers, all the\n",

        "existence he followed.\n",
        "What Ghaznavi had considered animal intuition or some sixth sense was merely the razor-edged faculties\n",
        "and savage wit of the barbarian. Conan had no instinct to tell him that men were watching him from a\n",
        "covert among the reeds of the mainland.\n",
        "As he climbed the cliff, one of these men breathed deeply and stealthily lifted a bow. Jehungir caught his\n",

        "our presence or guessed our plot. He may have warriors hidden somewhere. We will wait. In an hour, if\n",
        "nothing suspicious occurs, we'll row up to the foot of the stair and wait him there. If he does not return in \n",

        "with arrows from a safe distance.\"\n",
        "Meanwhile, the unsuspecting kozak had plunged into a forest. He went silently in his soft leather boots,\n",
        "his gaze sifting every shadow in eagerness to catch sight of the splendid, tawny-haired beauty of whom\n",
        "he had dreamed ever since he had seen her in the pavilion of Jehungir Agha by Fort Ghori. He would\n",
        "have desired her even if she had displayed repugnance toward him. But her cryptic smiles and glances\n",
        "had fired his blood, and with all the lawless violence which was his heritage he desired that whiteskinned, golden-haired woman of civilization.\n",
        "He had been on Xapur before. Less than a month ago, he had held a secret conclave here with a pirate\n",
        "crew. He knew that he was approaching a point where he could see the mysterious ruins which gave the\n",
        "island its name, and he wondered if he could find the girl hiding among them. Even with the thought, he\n",
        "stopped as though struck dead.\n",
        "Ahead of him, among the trees, rose something that his reason told him was not possible. It was a great\n",
        "dark green wall, with towers rearing beyond the battlements.\n",
        "Conan stood paralyzed in the disruption of the faculties which demoralizes anyone who is confronted by\n",
        "an impossible negation of sanity. He doubted neither his sight nor his reason, but something was\n",
        "monstrously out of joint. Less than a month ago, only broken ruins had showed among the trees. What\n",
        "human hands could rear such a mammoth pile as now met his eyes, in the few weeks which had elapsed?\n",
        "Besides, the buccaneers who roamed Vilyet ceaselessly would have learned of any work going on on such\n",
        "stupendous scale and would have informed the kozaks.\n",
        "There was no explaining this thing, but it was so. he was on Xapur, and that fantastic heap of towering\n",
        "masonry was on Xapur, and all was madness and paradox; yet it was all true.\n",
        "He wheeled to race back through the jungle, down the carven stair and across the blue waters to the\n",
        "distant camp at the mouth of the Zaporoska. In that moment of unreasoning panic, even the thought of\n",
        "halting so near the inland sea was repugnant. He would leave it behind him, would quit the armed\n",
        "camps and the steppes and put a thousand miles between him and the blue, mysterious East where the\n",
        "most basic laws of nature could be set at naught, by what diabolism he could not guess.\n",
        "For an instant, the future fate of kingdoms that hinged on this gay-clad barbarian hung in the balance. It\n",
        "was a small thing that tipped the scales--merely a shred of silk hanging on a bush that caught his uneasy\n",
        "glance. He leaned to it, his nostrils expanding, his nerves quivering to a subtle stimulant. On that bit of\n",
        "torn cloth, so faint that it was less with his physical faculties than by some obscure instinctive sense that\n",
        "he recognized it, lingered the tantalizing perfume that he connected with the sweet, firm flesh of the\n",
        "woman he had seen in Jehugir's pavilion. The fisherman had not lied, then; she was here! Then in the soil\n",
        "he saw a single track in the loam, the track of a bare foot, long and slender, but a man's, not a woman's,\n",
        "and sunk deeper than was natural. The conclusion was obvious; the man who made that track was\n",
        "carrying a burden, and what should it be but the girl the kozak was seeking?\n",
        "He stood silently facing the dark towers that loomed through the trees, his eyes slits of blue balefire.\n",
        "Desire for the yellow-haired woman vied with a sullen, primordial rage at whoever had taken her. His \n",
        "The Devil in Iron\n",
        "206\n",
        "human passion fought down his ultra-human fears, and dropping into the stalking crouch of a hunting\n",
        "panther, he glided toward the walls, taking advantage of the dense foliage to escape detection from the\n",
        "battlements.\n",
        "As he approached, he saw that the walls were composed of the same green stone that had formed the\n",
        "ruins, and he was haunted by a vague sense of familiarity. It was as if he looked upon something he had\n",
        "never before seen but had dreamed of or pictured mentally. At last he recognized the sensation. The walls\n",
        "and towers followed the plan of the ruins. It was as if the crumbling lines had grown back into the\n",
        "structures they originally were.\n",
        "No sound disturbed the morning quiet as Conan stole to the foot of the wall, which rose sheer from the\n",
        "luxuriant growth. On the southern reaches of the inland sea, the vegetation was almost tropical. He saw\n",
        "no one on the battlements, heard no sounds within. He saw a massive gate a short distance to his left and\n",
        "had no reason to suppose that it was not locked and guarded. But he believed that the woman he sought\n",
        "was somewhere beyond that wall, and the course he took was characteristically reckless.\n",
        "Above him, vine-festooned branches reached out toward the battlements. He went up a great tree like a\n",
        "cat, and reaching a point above the parapet, he gripped a thick limb with both hands, swung back and\n",
        "forth at arm's length until he had gained momentum, and then let go and catapulted through the air,\n",
        "landing catlike on the battlements. Crouching there, he stared down into the streets of a city.\n",
        "The circumference of the wall was not great, but the number of green stone buildings it contained was\n",
        "surprising. They were three or four stories in height, mainly flat-roofed, reflecting a fine architectural\n",
        "style. The streets converged like the spokes of a wheel into an octagon-shaped court in the centre of the\n",
        "town, which gave upon a lofty edifice, which, with its domes and towers, dominated the whole city. He\n",
        "saw no one moving in the streets or looking out of the windows, though the sun was already coming up.\n",
        "The silence that reigned there might have been that of a dead and deserted city. A narrow stone stair\n",
        "ascended the wall near him; down this he went.\n",
        "Houses shouldered so closely to the wall that halfway down the stair, he found himself within arm's\n",
        "length of a window and halted to peer in. There were no bars, and the silk curtains were caught back\n",
        "with satin cords. He looked into a chamber whose walls were hidden by dark velvet tapestires. The floor\n",
        "was covered with thick rugs, and there were benches of polished ebony and an ivory dais heaped with\n",
        "furs.\n",
        "He was about to continue his descent, when he heard the sound of someone approaching in the street\n",
        "below. Before the unknown person could round a corner and see him on the stair, he stepped quickly\n",
        "across the intervening space and dropped lightly into the room, drawing his scimitar. He stood for an\n",
        "instant statue-like; then, as nothing happened, he was moving across the rugs toward an arched doorway,\n",
        "when a hanging was drawn aside, revealing a cushioned alcove from which a slender, dark-haired girl\n",
        "regarded him with languid eyes.\n",
        "Conan glared at her tensely, expecting her momentarily to start screaming. But she merely smothered a\n",
        "yawn with a dainty hand, rose from the alcove, and leaned negligently against the hanging which she\n",
        "held with one hand.\n",
        "The Devil in Iron\n",
        "207\n",
        "She was undoubtedly a member of a white race, though her skin was very dark. Her square-cut hair was\n",
        "black as midnight, her only garment a wisp of silk about her supple hips.\n",
        "Presently she spoke, but the tongue was unfamiliar to him, and he shook his head. She yawned again,\n",
        "stretched lithely and, without any show of fear or surprise, shifted to a language he did understand, a\n",
        "dialect of Yuetshi which sounded strangely archaic.\n",
        "\"Are you looking for someone?\" she asked, as indifferently as if the invasion of her chamber by an armed\n",
        "stranger were the most common thing imaginable.\n",
        "\"Who are you?\" he demanded.\n",
        "\"I am Yateli,\" she answered languidly. \"I must have feasted late last night, I am so sleepy now. Who are\n",
        "you?\"\n",
        "\"I am Conan, a hetman among the kozaks,\" he answered, watching her narrowly. He believed her attitude\n",
        "to be a pose and expected her to try to escape from the chamber or rouse the house. But, though a velvet\n",
        "rope that might be a signal cord hung near her, she did not reach for it.\n",
        "\"Conan,\" she repeated drowsily. \"You are not a Dagonian. I suppose you are a mercenary. Have you cut\n",
        "the heads off many Yuetshi?\"\n",
        "\"I do not war on water rats!\" he snorted.\n",
        "\"But they are very terrible,\" she murmured. \"I remember when they were our slaves. But they revolted\n",
        "and burned and slew. Only the magic of Khosatral Khel has kept them from the walls--\" she paused, a\n",
        "puzzled look struggling with the sleepiness of her expression. \"I forgot,\" she muttered. \"They did climb\n",
        "the walls, last night. There was shouting and fire, and the people calling in vain on Khosatral.\" She shook\n",
        "her head as if to clear it. \"But that cannot be,\" she murmured, \"because I am alive, and I thought I was\n",
        "dead. Oh, to the devil with it!\"\n",
        "She came across the chamber, and taking Conan's hand, drew him to the dais. He yielded in\n",
        "bewilderment and uncertainty. The girl smiled at him like a sleepy child; her long silky lashes drooped\n",
        "over dusky, clouded eyes. She ran her fingers through his thick black locks as if to assure herself of his\n",
        "reality.\n",
        "\"It was a dream,\" she yawned. \"Perhaps it's all a dream. I feel like a dream now. I don't care. I can't\n",
        "remember something--I have forgotten--there is something I cannot understand, but I grow so sleepy\n",
        "when I try to think. Anyway, it doesn't matter.\"\n",
        "\"What do you mean?\" he asked uneasily. \"You said they climbed the walls last night? Who?\"\n",
        "\"The Yuetshi. I thought so, anyway. A cloud of smoke hid everything, but a naked, bloodstained devil\n",
        "caught me by the throat and drove his knife into my breast. Oh, it hurt! But it was a dream, because see,\n",
        "there is no scar.\" She idly inspected her smooth bosom, and then sank upon Conan's lap and passed her\n",
        "supple arms about his massive neck. \"I cannot remember,\" she murmured, nestling her dark head against\n",
        "his mighty breast. \"Everything is dim and misty. It does not matter. You are no dream. You are strong.\n",
        "Let us live while we can. Love me!\"\n",
        "The Devil in Iron\n",
        "208\n",
        "He cradled the girl's glossy head in the bend of his heavy arm and kissed her full red lips with unfeigned\n",
        "relish.\n",
        "\"You are strong,\" she repeated, her voice waning. \"Love me--love --\" The sleepy murmur faded away; the\n",
        "dusky eyes closed, the long lashes drooping over the sensuous cheeks; the supple body relaxed in\n",
        "Conan's arms.\n",
        "He scowled down at her. She seemed to partake of the illusion that haunted this whole city, but the firm\n",
        "resilience of her limbs under his questing fingers convinced him that he had a living human girl in his\n",
        "arms, and not the shadow of a dream. No less disturbed, he hastily laid her on the furs upon the dais. Her\n",
        "sleep was too deep to be natural. He decided that she must be an addict of some drug, perhaps like the\n",
        "black lotus of Xuthal.\n",
        "Then he found something else to make him wonder. Among the furs on the dais was a gorgeous spotted\n",
        "skin, whose predominant hue was golden. It was not a clever copy, but the skin of an actual beast. And\n",
        "that beast, Conan knew, had been extinct for at least a thousand years; it was the great golden leopard\n",
        "which figures so prominently in Hyborian legendry, and which the ancient artists delighted to portray in\n",
        "pigments and marble.\n",
        "Shaking his head in bewilderment, Conan passed through the archway into a winding corridor. Silence\n",
        "hung over the house, but outside he heard a sound which his keen ears recognized as something\n",
        "ascending the stair on the wall from which he had entered the building. An instant later he was startled\n",
        "to hear something land with a soft but weighty thud on the floor of the chamber he had just quitted.\n",
        "Turning quickly away, he hurried along the twisting hallway until something on the floor before him\n",
        "brought him to a halt.\n",
        "It was a human figure, which lay half in the hall and half in an opening that obviously was normally\n",
        "concealed by a door, which was a duplicate of the panels of the wall. It was a man, dark and lean, clad\n",
        "only in a silk loincloth, with a shaven head and cruel features, and he lay as if death had struck him just\n",
        "as he was emerging from the panel. Conan bent above him, seeking the cause of his death, and\n",
        "discovered him to be merely sunk in the same deep sleep as the girl in the chamber.\n",
        "But why should he select such a place for his slumbers? While meditating on the matter, Conan was\n",
        "galvanized by a sound behind him. Something was moving up the corridor in his direction. A quick\n",
        "glance down it showed that it ended in a great door, which might be locked. Conan jerked the supine\n",
        "body out of the panel entrance and stepped through, pulling the panel shut after him. A click told him it\n",
        "was locked in place. Standing in utter darkness, he heard a shuffling tread halt just outside the door, and\n",
        "a faint chill trickled along his spine. That was no human step, nor that of any beast he had ever\n",
        "encountered.\n",
        "There was an instant of silence, then a faint creak of wood and metal. Putting out his hand he felt the\n",
        "door straining and bending inward, as if a great weight were being steadily borne against it from the\n",
        "outside. As he reached for his sword, this ceased and he heard a strange, slobbering mouthing that\n",
        "prickled the short hairs on his scalp. Scimitar in hand, he began backing away, and his heels felt steps,\n",
        "down which he nearly tumbled. He was in a narrow staircase leading downward.\n",
        "The Devil in Iron\n",
        "209\n",
        "He groped his way down in the blackness, feeling for, but not finding, some other opening in the walls.\n",
        "Just as he decided that he was no longer in the house, but deep in the earth under it, the steps ceased in a\n",
        "level tunnel.\n",
        "V\n",
        "\n",
        "Along the dark, silent tunnel Conan groped, momentarily dreading a fall into some unseen pit; but at last\n",
        "his feet struck steps again, and he went up them until he came to a door on which his fumbling fingers\n",
        "found a metal catch. He came out into a dim and lofty room of enormous proportions. Fantastic columns\n",
        "marched about the mottled walls, upholding a ceiling, which, at once translucent and dusky, seemed like\n",
        "a cloudy midnight sky, giving an illusion of impossible height. If any light filtered in from the outside, it\n",
        "was curiously altered.\n",
        "In a brooding twilight, Conan moved across the bare green floor. The great room was circular, pierced on\n",
        "one side by the great, bronze valves of a giant door. Opposite this, on a dais against the wall, up to which\n",
        "led broad curving steps, there stood a throne of copper, and when Conan saw what was coiled on this\n",
        "throne, he retreated hastily, lifting his scimitar.\n",
        "Then, as the thing did not move, he scanned it more closely and presently mounted the glass steps and\n",
        "stared down at it. It was a gigantic snake, apparently carved of some jadelike substance. Each scale stood\n",
        "out as distinctly as in real life, and the iridescent colors were vividly reproduced. The great wedgeshaped head was half submerged in the folds of its trunk; so neither the eyes nor jaws were visible.\n",
        "Recognition stirred in his mind. The snake was evidently meant to represent one of those grim monsters\n",
        "of the marsh, which in past ages had haunted the reedy edges of Vilayet's southern shores. But, like the\n",
        "golden leopard, they had been extinct for hundreds of years. Conan had seen rude images of them, in\n",
        "minature, among the idol huts of the Yuetshi, and there was a description of them in the Book of Skelos,\n",
        "which drew on prehistoric sources.\n",
        "Conan admired the scaly torso, thick as his thigh and obviously of great length, and he reached out and\n",
        "laid a curious hand on the thing. And as he did so, his heart nearly stopped. An icy chill congealed the\n",
        "blood in his veins and lifted the short hair on his scalp. Under his hand there was not the smooth, brittle\n",
        "surface of glass or metal or stone, but the yielding, fibrous mass of a living thing. He felt cold, sluggish\n",
        "life flowing under his fingers.\n",
        "His hand jerked back in instinctive repulsion. Sword shaking in his grasp, horror and revulsion and fear\n",
        "almost choking him, he backed away and down the glass steps with painful care, glaring in awful\n",
        "fascinastion at the grisly thing that slumbered on the copper throne. It did not move.\n",
        "He reached the bronze door and tried it, with his heart in his teeth, sweating with fear that he should find\n",
        "himself locked in with that slimy horror. But the valves yielded to his touch, and he glided though and\n",
        "closed them behind him.\n",
        "He found himself in a wide hallway with lofty, tapestried walls, where the light was the same twilight\n",
        "gloom. It made distant objects indistinct, and that made him uneasy, rousing thoughts of serpents gliding \n",
        "The Devil in Iron\n",
        "210\n",
        "unseen through the dimness. A door at the other end seemed miles away in the illusive light. Nearer at\n",
        "hand, the tapestry hung in such a way as to suggest an opening behind it, and lifting it cautiously he\n",
        "discovered a narrow stair leading up.\n",
        "While he hesitated he heard, in the great room he had just left, the same shuffling tread he had heard\n",
        "outside the locked panel. Had he been followed through the tunnel? He went up the stair hastily,\n",
        "dropping the tapestry in place behind him.\n",
        "Emerging presently into a twisting corridor, he took the first doorway he came to. He had a twofold\n",
        "purpose in his apparently aimless prowling; to escape from the building and its mysteries, and to find the\n",
        "Nemedian girl who, he felt, was imprisoned somewhere in this palace, temple, or whatever it was. He\n",
        "believed it was the great domed edifice at the center of the city, and it was likely that here dwelt the ruler\n",
        "of the town, to whom a captive woman would doubtless be brought.\n",
        "He found himself in a chamber, not another corridor, and was about to retrace his steps, when he heard a\n",
        "voice which came from behind one of the walls. There was no door in that wall, but he leaned close and\n",
        "heard distinctly. And an icy chill crawled slowly along his spine. The tongue was Nemedian, but the\n",
        "voice was not human. There was a terifying resonance about it, like a bell tolling at midnight.\n",
        "\"There was no life in the Abyss, save that which was incorporated in me,\" it tolled. \"Nor was there light,\n",
        "nor motion, nor any sound. Only the urge behind and beyond life guided and impelled me on my\n",
        "upward journey, blind, insensate, inexorable. Through ages upon ages, and the changeless strata of\n",
        "darkness I climbed--\"\n",
        "Ensorcelled by that belling resonance, Conan crouched forgetful of all else, until its hypnotic power\n",
        "caused a strange replacement of faculties and perception, and sound created the illusion of sight. Conan\n",
        "was no longer aware of the voice, save as far-off rhythmical waves of sound. Transported beyond his age\n",
        "and his own individuality, he was seeing the transmutation of the being men called Khosatral Khel which\n",
        "crawled up from Night and the Abyss ages ago to clothe itself in the substance of the material universe.\n",
        "But human flesh was too frail, too paltry to hold the terrific essence that was Khosatral Khel. So he stood\n",
        "up in the shape and aspect of a man, but his flesh was not flesh; nor the bone, bone; nor blood, blood. He\n",
        "became a blasphemy against all nature, for he caused to live and think and act a basic substance that\n",
        "before had never known the pulse and stir of animate being.\n",
        "He stalked through the world as a god, for no earthly weapon could harm him, and to him a century was\n",
        "like an hour. In his wanderings he came upon a primitive people inhabiting the island of Dagonia, and it\n",
        "pleased him to give this race culture and civilization, and by his aid they built the city of Dagon and they\n",
        "abode there and worshipped him. Strange and grisly were his servants, called from the dark corners of\n",
        "the planet where grim survivals of forgotten ages yet lurked. His house in Dagon was connected with\n",
        "every other house by tunnels through which his shaven-headed priests bore victims for the sacrifice.\n",
        "But after many ages, a fierce and brutish people appeared on the shores of the sea. They called\n",
        "themselves Yuetshi, and after a fierce battle were defeated and enslaved, and for nearly a generation they\n",
        "died on the altars of Khosatral.\n",
        "His sorcery kept them in bonds. Then their priest, a strange, gaunt man of unknown race, plunged into\n",
        "the wilderness, and when he returned he bore a knife that was of no earthly substance. It was forged of a \n",
        "The Devil in Iron\n",
        "211\n",
        "meteor, which flashed through the sky like a flaming arrow and fell in a far valley. The slaves rose. Their\n",
        "saw-edged crescents cut down the men of Dagon like sheep, and against that unearthly knife the magic of\n",
        "Khosatral was impotent. While carnage and slaughter bellowed through the red smoke that choked the\n",
        "streets, the grimmest act of that grim drama was played in the cryptic dome behind the great daised\n",
        "chamber with its copper throne and its walls mottled like the skin of serpents.\n",
        "From that dome, the Yuetshi priest emerged alone. He had not slain his foe, because he wished to hold\n",
        "the threat of his loosing over the heads of his own rebellious subjects. He had left Khosatral lying upon\n",

        "through which stole hooded figures of grisly potentialities. Through the belling of the voice, which was\n",
        "like a tolling of triumph over the ordered laws of a sane planet, a human sound anchored Conan's mind\n",

        "hidden there. But another surmise occurred to the Agha. Suppose the hetman had left his warriors near\n",
        "by, and that they should grow suspicious and come to investigate his long absence? Jehungir spoke to the\n",
        "oarsmen, and the long boat slid from among the reeds and glided toward the carven stairs.\n",
        "The Devil in Iron\n",
        "212\n",
        "Leaving half a dozen men in the boat, he took the rest, ten mighty archers of Khawarizm, in spired\n",
        "helmets and tiger-skin cloaks. Like hunters invading the retreat of the lion, they stole forward under the\n",

        "been a parrot swirled over their heads with a low thunder of broad wings and then sped off through the\n",
        "trees. With a sudden gesture, Jehungir halted his party, and they stared incredulously at the towers that\n",
        "showed through the verdure in the distance.\n",
        "\"Tarim!\" muttered Jehungir. \"The pirates have rebuilt the ruins! Doubtless Conan is there. We must\n",

        "With renewed caution, they glided through the trees. The game had altered; from pursuers and hunters\n",

        "Conan realized with a crawling of his skin that beyond the wall the belling voice had ceased. He stood\n",
        "motionless as a statue, his gaze fixed on a curtained door through which he knew that a culminating\n",
        "horror would presently appear.\n",
        "It was dim and misty in the chamber, and Conan's hair began to lift on his scalp as he looked. He saw a\n",
        "head and a pair of gigantic shoulders grow out of the twilight doom. There was no sound of footsteps,\n",
        "but the great dusky form grew more distinct until Conan recognized the figure of a man. He was clad in\n",
        "sandals, a skirt, and a broad shagreen girdle. His square-cut mane was confined by a circle of gold. Conan\n",
        "stared at the sweep of the monstrous shoulders, the breadth of swelling breast, the bands and ridges and\n",
        "clusters of muscles on torso and limbs. The face was without weakness and without mercy. The eyes were\n",
        "balls of dark fire. And Conan knew that this was Khosatral Khel, the ancient from the Abyss, the god of\n",
        "Dagonia.\n",
        "No word was spoken. No word was necessary. Khosatral spread his great arms, and Conan, crouching\n",
        "beneath them, slashed at the giant's belly. Then he bounded back, eyes blazing with surprise. The keen\n",
        "edge had rung on the mighty body as on an anvil, rebounding without cutting. Then Khosatral came\n",
        "upon him in an irrestible surge.\n",
        "There was a fleeting concussion, a fierce writhing and intertwining of limbs and bodies, and then Conan\n",
        "sprang clear, every thew quivering from the violence of his efforts; blood started where the grazing\n",
        "fingers had torn the skin. In that instant of contact, he had experienced the ultimate madness of\n",
        "blasphemed nature; no human flesh had bruised his, but metal animated and sentient; it was a body of\n",
        "living iron which opposed his.\n",
        "Khosatral loomed above the warrior in the gloom. Once let those great fingers lock and they would not\n",
        "loosen until the human body hung limp in their grasp. In that twilit chambr it was as if a man fought\n",
        "with a dream-monster in a nightmare.\n",
        "Flinging down his useless sword, Conan caught up a heavy bench and hurled it with all his power. It was\n",
        "such a missile as few men could even lift. On Khosatral's mighty breast it smashed into shreds and\n",
        "splinters. It did not even shake the giant on his braced legs. His face lost something of its human aspect, a\n",
        "nimbus of fire played about his awesome head, and like a moving tower he came on.\n",
        "The Devil in Iron\n",
        "213\n",
        "With a desperate wrench Conan ripped a whole section of tapestry from the wall and whirling it, with a\n",
        "muscular effort greater than that required for throwing the bench, he flung it over the giant's head. For an\n",
        "instant Khosatral floundered, smothered and blinded by the clinging stuff that resisted his strength as\n",
        "wood or steel could not have done, and in that instant Conan caught up his scimitar and shot out into the\n",
        "corridor. Without checking his speed, he hurled himself through the door of the adjoining chamber,\n",
        "slammed the door, and shot the bolt.\n",
        "Then as he wheeled, he stopped short, all the blood in him seeming to surge to his head. Crouching on a\n",
        "heap of silk cushions, golden hair streaming over her naked shoulders, eyes blank with terror, was the\n",
        "woman for whom he had dared so much. He almost forgot the horror at his heels until a splintering crash\n",
        "behind him brought him to his senses. He caught up the girl and sprang for the opposite door. She was\n",
        "too helpless with fright either to resist or to aid him. A faint whimper was the only sound of which she\n",
        "seemed capable.\n",
        "Conan wasted no time trying the door. A shattering stroke of his scimitar hewed the lock asunder, and as\n",
        "he sprang through to the stair that loomed beyond it, he saw the head and shoulders of Khosatral crash\n",
        "through the other door. The colossus was splintering the massive panels as if they were of cardboard.\n",
        "Conan raced up the stair, carrying the big girl over one shoulder as easily as if she had been a child.\n",
        "Where he was going he had no idea, but the stair ended at the door of a round, domed chamber.\n",
        "Khosatral was coming up the stair behind them, silently as a wind of death, and as swiftly.\n",
        "The chamber's walls were of solid steel, and so was the door. Conan shut it and dropped in place the\n",
        "great bars with which it was furnished. The thought struck him that this was Khosatral's chamber, where\n",
        "he locked himself in to sleep securely from the monsters he had loosed from the Pits to do his bidding.\n",
        "Hardly were the bolts in place when the great door shook and trembled to the giant's assault. Conan\n",
        "shrugged his shoulders. This was the end of the trail. There was no other door in the chamber, nor any\n",
        "window. Air, and the strange misty light, evidently came from interstices in the dome. He tested the\n",
        "nicked edge of his scimitar, quite cool now that he was at bay. He had done his volcanic best to escape;\n",
        "when the giant came crashing through that door, he would explode in another savage onslaught with the\n",
        "useless sword, not because he expected it to do any good, but because it was his nature to die fighting.\n",
        "For the moment there was no course of action to take, and his calmness was not forced or feigned.\n",
        "The gaze he turned on his fair companion was as admiring and intense as if he had a hundred years to\n",
        "live. He had dumped her unceremoniously on the floor when he turned to close the door, and she had\n",
        "risen to her knees, mechanically arranging her streaming locks and her scanty garment. Conan's fierce\n",
        "eyes glowed with approval as they devoured her thick golden hair, her clear, wide eyes, her milky skin,\n",
        "sleek with exuberant health, the firm swell of her breasts, the contours of her splendid hips.\n",
        "A low cry escaped her as the door shook and a bolt gave way with a groan.\n",
        "Conan did not look around. He knew the door would hold a little while longer.\n",
        "\"They told me you had escaped,\" he said. \"A Yuetshi fisher told me you were hiding here. What is your\n",
        "name?\"\n",
        "The Devil in Iron\n",
        "214\n",
        "\"Octavia,\" she gasped mechanically. Then words came in a rush. She caught at him with desperate fingers.\n",
        "\"Oh Mitra! what nightmare is this? The people--the dark-skinned people--one of them caught me in the\n",
        "forest and brought me here. They carried me to--to that--that thing. He told me--he said--am I mad? Is\n",
        "this a dream?\"\n",
        "He glanced at the door which bulged inward as if from the impact of a battering-ram.\n",
        "\"No,\" he said; \"it's no dream. That hinge is giving way. Strange that a devil has to break down a door like\n",
        "a common man; but after all, his strength itself is a diabolism.\"\n",
        "\"Can you not kill him?\" she panted. \"You are strong.\"\n",
        "Conan was too honest to lie to her. \"If a mortal man could kill him, he'd be dead now,\" he answered. \"I\n",
        "nicked my blade on his belly.\"\n",
        "Her eyes dulled. \"Then you must die, and I must--oh Mitra!\" she screamed in sudden frenzy, and Conan\n",
        "caught her hands, fearing that she would harm herself. \"He told me what he was going to do to me!\" she\n",
        "panted. \"Kill me! Kill me with your sword before he bursts the door!\"\n",
        "Conan looked at her and shook his head.\n",
        "\"I'll do what I can,\" he said. \"That won't be much, but it'll give you a chance to get past him down the stair.\n",
        "Then run for the cliffs. I have a boat tied at the foot of the steps. If you can get out of the palace, you may\n",
        "escape him yet. The people of this city are all asleep.\"\n",
        "She dropped her head in her hands. Conan took up his scimitar and moved over to stand before the\n",
        "echoing door. One watching him would not have realized that he was waiting for a death he regarded as\n",
        "inevitable. His eyes smoldered more vividly; his muscular hand knotted harder on his hilt; that was all.\n",
        "The hinges had given under the giant's terrible assault, and the door rocked crazily, held only by the bolts.\n",
        "And these solid steel bars were buckling, bending, bulging out of their sockets. Conan watched in an\n",
        "almost impersonal fascination, envying the monster his inhuman strength.\n",
        "Then, without warning, the bombardment ceased. In the stillness, Conan heard other noises on the\n",
        "landing outside--the beat of wings, and a muttering voice that was like the whining of wind through\n",
        "midnight branches. Then presently there was silence, but there was a new feel in the air. Only the\n",
        "whetted instincts of barbarism could have sensed it, but Conan knew, without seeing or hearing him\n",
        "leave, that the master of Dagon no longer stood outside the door.\n",
        "He glared through a crack that had been started in the steel of the portal. The landing was empty. He\n",
        "drew the warped bolts and cautiously pulled aside the sagging door. Khosatral was not on the stair, but\n",
        "far below he heard the clang of a metal door. He did not know whether the giant was plotting new\n",
        "deviltries or had been summoned away by that muttering voice, but he wasted no time in conjectures.\n",
        "He called to Octavia, and the new note in his voice brought her up to her feet and to his side almost\n",
        "without her conscious volition.\n",
        "\"What is it?\" she gasped.\n",
        "The Devil in Iron\n",
        "215\n",
        "\"Don't stop to talk!\" He caught her wrist. \"Come on!\" The chance for action had transformed him; his eyes\n",
        "blazed, his voice crackled. \"The knife!\" he muttered, while almost dragging the girl down the stair in his\n",
        "fierce haste. \"The magic Yuetshi blade! He left it in the dome! I--\" his voice died suddenly as a clear\n",
        "mental picture sprang up before him. That dome adjoined the great room where stood the copper throne-\n",
        "-sweat started out on his body. The only way to that dome was through that room with the copper throne\n",
        "and the foul thing that slumbered in it.\n",
        "But he did not hesitate. Swiftly they descended the stair, crossed the chamber, descended the next stair,\n",
        "and came into the great dim hall with its mysterious hangings. They had seen no sign of the colossus.\n",
        "Halting before the great bronze-valved door, Conan caught Octavia by her shoulders and shook her in his\n",
        "intensity.\n",
        "\"Listen!\" he snapped. \"I'm going into the room and fasten the door. Stand here and listen; if Khosatral\n",
        "comes, call to me. If you hear me cry out for you to go, run as though the Devil were on your heels--\n",
        "which he probably will be. Make for that door at the other end of the hall, because I'll be past helping you.\n",
        "I'm going for the Yuetshi knife!\"\n",
        "Before she could voice the protest her lips were framing, he had slid through the valves and shut them\n",
        "behind him. He lowered the bolt cautiously, not noticing that it could be worked from the outside. In the\n",
        "dim twilight his gaze sought that grim copper throne; yes, the scaly brute was still there, filling the throne\n",
        "with its loathsome coils. He saw a door behind the throne and knew that it led into the dome. But to reach\n",
        "it he must mount the dais, a few feet from the throne itself.\n",
        "A wind blowing across the green floor would have made more noise than Conan's slinking feet. Eyes\n",
        "glued on the sleeping reptile he reached the dais and mounted the glass steps. The snake had not moved.\n",
        "He was reaching for the door . . .\n",
        "The bolt on the bronze portal clanged and Conan stifled an awful oath as he saw Octavia come into the\n",
        "room. She stared about, uncertain in the deeper gloom, and he stood frozen, not daring to shout a\n",
        "warning. Then she saw his shadowy figure and ran toward the dais, crying: \"I want to go with you! I'm\n",
        "afraid to stay alone--oh!\" She threw up her hands with a terrible scream as for the first time she saw the\n",
        "occupant of the throne. The wedge-shaped head had lifted from its coils and thrust out toward her on a\n",
        "yard of shining neck.\n",
        "Then with a smooth, flowing motion, it began to ooze from the throne, coil by coil, its ugly head bobbing\n",
        "in the direction of the paralyzed girl.\n",
        "Conan cleared the space between him and the throne with a desperate bound, his scimitar swinging with\n",
        "all his power. And with such blinding speed did the serpent move that it whipped about and met him in\n",
        "full midair, lapping his limbs and body with half a dozen coils. His half-checked stroke fell futilely as he\n",
        "crashed down on the dais, gashing the scaly trunk but not severing it.\n",
        "Then he was writhing on the glass steps with fold after slimy fold knotting about him, twisting, crushing,\n",
        "killing him. His right arm was still free, but he could get no purchase to strike a killing blow, and he\n",
        "knew one blow must suffice. With a groaning convulsion of muscular expansion that bulged his veins\n",
        "almost to bursting on his temples and tied his muscles in quivering, tortured knots, he heaved up on his\n",
        "feet, lifting almost the full weight of that forty-foot devil.\n",
        "The Devil in Iron\n",
        "216\n",
        "An instant he reeled on wide-braced legs, feeling his ribs caving in on his vitals and his sight growing\n",
        "dark, while his scimitar gleamed above his head. Then it fell, shearing through the scales and flesh and\n",
        "vertebrae. And where there had been one huge, writhing cable, now there were horribly two, lashing and\n",
        "flopping in the death throes. Conan staggered away from their blind strokes. He was sick and dizzy, and\n",
        "blood oozed from his nose. Groping in a dark mist he clutched Octavia and shook her until she gasped\n",
        "for breath.\n",
        "\"Next time I tell you to stay somewhere,\" he gasped, \"you stay!\"\n",
        "He was too dizzy even to know whether she replied. Taking her wrist like a truant schoolgirl, he led her\n",
        "around the hideous stumps that still loomed and knotted on the floor. Somewhere, in the distance, he\n",
        "thought he heard men yelling, but his ears were still roaring so that he could not be sure.\n",
        "The door gave to his efforts. If Khosatral had placed the snake there to guard the thing he feared,\n",
        "evidently he considered it ample precaution. Conan half expected some other monstrosity to leap at him\n",
        "with the opening of the door, but in the dimmer light he saw only the vague sweep of the arch above, a\n",
        "dully gleaming block of gold, and a half-moon glimmer on the stone.\n",
        "With a gasp of gratification, he scooped it up and did not linger for further exploration. He turned and\n",
        "fled across the room and down the great hall toward the distant door that he felt led to the outer air. He\n",
        "was correct. A few minutes later he emerged into the silent streets, half carrying, half guiding his\n",
        "companion. There was no one to be seen, but beyond the western wall there sounded cries and moaning\n",
        "wails that made Octavia tremble. He led her to the southwestern wall and without difficulty found a\n",
        "stone stair that mounted the rampart. He had appropriated a thick tapestry rope in the great hall, and\n",
        "now, having reached the parapet, he looped the soft, strong cord about the girl's hips and lowered her to\n",
        "the earth. Then, making one end fast to a merlon, he slid down after her. There was but one way of escape\n",
        "from the island--the stair on the western cliffs. In that direction he hurried, swinging wide around the\n",
        "spot from which had come the cries and the sound of terrible blows.\n",
        "Octavia sensed that grim peril lurked in those leafy fastnesses. Her breath came pantingly and she\n",
        "pressed close to her protector. But the forest was slient now, and they saw no shape of menace until they\n",
        "emerged from the trees and glimpsed a figure standing on the edge of the cliffs.\n",
        "Jehungir Agha had escaped the doom that had overtaken his warriors when an iron giant sallied\n",
        "suddenly from the gate and battered and crushed them into bits of shredded flesh and splintered bone.\n",
        "When he saw the swords of his archers break on that manlike juggernaut, he had known it was no human\n",
        "foe they faced, and he had fled, hiding in the deep woods until the sounds of slaughter ceased. Then he\n",
        "crept back to the stair, but his boatmen were not waiting for him.\n",
        "They had heard the screams, and presently, waiting nervously, had seen, on the cliff above them, a bloodsmeared monster waving gigantic arms in awful triumph. They had waited for no more. When Jehungir\n",
        "came upon the cliffs, they were just vanishing among the reeds beyond earshot. Khosatral was gone--had\n",
        "either returned to the city or was prowling the forest in search of the man who had escaped him outside\n",

        "Jehungir was just preparing to descend the stairs and depart in Conan's boat, when he saw the hetman\n",
        "and the girl emerge from the trees. The experience which had congealed his blood and almost blasted his \n",
        "The Devil in Iron\n",
        "217\n",
        "reason had not altered Jehungir's intentions towards the kozak chief. The sight of the man he had come to\n",
        "kill filled him with gratification. He was astonished to see the girl he had given to Jelal Khan, but he\n",
        "wasted no time on her. Lifting his bow he drew the shaft to its head and loosed. Conan crouched and the\n",
        "arror splintered on a tree, and Conan laughed.\n",
        "\"Dog!\" he taunted. \"You can't hit me! I was not born to die on Hyrkanian steel! Try again, pig of Turan!\"\n",
        "Jehungir did not try again. That was his last arrow. He drew his scimitar and advanced, confident in his\n",
        "spired helmet and close-meshed mail. Conan met him halfway in a blinding whirl of swords. The curved\n",
        "blades ground together, sprang apart, circled in glittering arcs that blurred the sight which tried to follow\n",
        "them. Octavia, watching, did not see the stroke, but she heard its chopping impact and saw Jehungir fall,\n",
        "blood spurting from his side where the Cimmerian's steel had sundered his mail and bitten to his spine.\n",
        "But Octavia's scream was not caused by the death of her former master. With a crash of bending boughs,\n",
        "Khosatral Khel was upon them. The girl could not flee; a moaning cry escaped her as her knees gave way\n",
        "and pitched her groveling to the sward.\n",
        "Conan, stooping above the body of the Agha, made no move to escape. Shifting his reddened scimitar to\n",
        "his left hand, he drew the great half-blade of the Yuetshi. Khosatral Khel was towering above him, his\n",
        "arms lifted like mauls, but as the blade caught the sheen of the sun, the giant gave back suddenly.\n",
        "But Conan's blood was up. He rushed in, slashing with the crescent blade. And it did not splinter. Under\n",
        "its edge, the dusky metal of Khosatral's body gave way like common flesh beneath a cleaver. From the\n",
        "deep gash flowed a strange ichor, and Khosatral cried out like the dirging of a great bell. His terrible arms\n",
        "flailed down, but Conan, quicker than the archers who had died beneath those awful flails, avoided their\n",
        "strokes and struck again and yet again. Khosatral reeled and tottered; his cries were awful to hear, as if\n",
        "metal were given a tongue of pain, as if iron shrieked and bellowed under torment.\n",
        "Then, wheeling away, he staggered into the forest; he reeled in his gait, crashed through bushes, and\n",

        "drop a word of warning. \"I can not predict what the chief Conan's action will be. The tribesmen are\n",
        "always turbulent, and I have reason to believe that emissaries from the Turanians are stirring them up to\n",
        "raid our borders. As your majesty knows, the Turanians have established themselves in Secunderam and\n",
        "other northern cities, though the hill tribes remain unconquered. King Yezdigerd has long looked\n",
        "southward with greedy lust and perhaps is seeking to gain by treachery what he could not win by force\n",
        "of arms. I have thought that Conan might well be one of his spies.\"\n",
        "\"We shall see,\" she answered. \"If he loves his followers, he will be at the gates at dawn, to parley. I shall\n",
        "spend the night in the fortress. I came in disguise to Peshkhauri, and lodged my retinue at an inn instead\n",
        "of the palace. Besides my people, only yourself knows of my presence here.\"\n",
        "\"I shall escort you to your quarters, Your Majesty,\" said the governor, and as they emerged from the\n",

        "The maid waited, veiled like her mistress, outside the door, and the group traversed a wide, winding\n",
        "corridor, lighted by smoky torches, and reached the quarters reserved for visiting notables--generals and\n",
        "viceroys, mostly; none of the royal family had ever honored the fortress before. Chunder Shan had a\n",
        "perturbed feeling that the suite was not suitable to such an exalted personage as the Devi, and though she\n",
        "sought to make him feel at ease in her presence, he was glad when she dismissed him and he bowed\n",
        "himself out. All the menials of the fort had been summoned to serve his royal guest--though he did not\n",
        "divulge her identity--and he stationed a squad of spearmen before her doors, among them the warrior\n",
        "who had guarded his own chamber. In his preoccupation he forgot to replace the man.\n",
        "The governor had not been long gone from her when Yasmina suddenly remembered something else\n",
        "which she had wished to discuss with him, but had forgotten until that moment. It concerned the past \n",
        "The People of the Black Circle\n",
        "226\n",
        "actions of one Kerim Shah, a nobleman from Iranistan, who had dwelt for a while in Peshkhauri before\n",
        "coming on to the court at Ayodhya. A vague suspicion concerning the man had been stirred by a glimpse\n",
        "of him in Peshkhauri that night. She wondered if he had followed her from Ayodhya. Being a truly\n",
        "remarkable Devi, she did not summon the governor to her again, but hurried out into the corridor alone,\n",
        "and hastened toward his chamber.\n",
        "Chunder Shan, entering his chamber, closed the door and went to his table. There he took the letter he\n",
        "had been writing and tore it to bits. Scarcely had he finished when he heard something drop softly onto\n",
        "the parapet adjacent to the window. He looked up to see a figure loom briefly against the stars, and then\n",
        "a man dropped lightly into the room. The light glinted on a long sheen of steel in his hand.\n",
        "\"Shhhh!\" he warned. \"Don't make a noise, or I'll send the devil a henchman!\"\n",
        "The governor checked his motion toward the sword on the table. He was within reach of the yard-long\n",
        "Zhaibar knife that glittered in the intruder's fist, and he knew the desperate quickness of a hillman.\n",
        "The invader was a tall man, at once strong and supple. He was dressed like a hillman, but his dark\n",
        "features and blazing blue eyes did not match his garb. Chunder Shan had never seen a man like him; he\n",
        "was not an Easterner, but some barbarian from the West. But his aspect was as untamed and formidable\n",
        "as any of the hairy tribesmen who haunt the hills of Ghulistan.\n",
        "\"You come like a thief in the night,\" commented the governor, recovering some of his composure,\n",
        "although he remembered that there was no guard within call. Still, the hillman could not know that.\n",
        "\"I climbed a bastion,\" snarled the intruder. \"A guard thrust his head over the battlement in time for me to\n",

        "Crom, I've come! Keep away from that table or I'll gut you.\"\n",
        "\"I merely wish to seat myself,\" answered the governor, carefully sinking into the ivory chair, which he\n",
        "wheeled away from the table. Conan moved restlessly before him, glancing suspiciously at the door,\n",
        "thumbing the razor edge of his three-foot knife. He did not walk like an Afghuli, and was bluntly direct\n",
        "where the East is subtle.\n",
        "\"You have seven of my men,\" he said abruptly. \"You refused the ransom I offered. What the devil do you\n",
        "want?\"\n",
        "\"Let us discuss terms,\" answered Chunder Shan cautiously.\n",
        "\"Terms?\" There was a timbre of dangerous anger in his voice. \"What do you mean? Haven't I offered you\n",
        "gold?\"\n",
        "Chunder Shan laughed.\n",

        "\"You're a liar,\" retorted Conan. \"I've seen the suk of the goldsmiths in Khurusun.\"\n",
        "\"Well, more than an Afghuh ever saw,\" amended Chunder Shan. \"And it is but a drop of all the treasure\n",
        "of Vendhya. Why should we desire gold? It would be more to our advantage to hang these seven\n",
        "thieves.\"\n",

        "A wild blue flame flickered in the hillman's eyes, but Chunder Shan shrugged his shoulders, though\n",
        "keeping an eye on the keen steel.\n",
        "\"You can kill me easily, and probably escape over the wall afterward. But that would not save the seven\n",

        "Looking at the man as he stood squarely, knife in fist and eyes glaring, Chunder Shan did not doubt that\n",
        "he was capable of it. The governor did not believe any hill-horde could take Peshkhauri, but he did not\n",
        "wish a devastated countryside.\n",

        "flame up in the fierce blue eyes.\n",
        "The governor shouted desperately and caught at his sword, but the hillman moved with the devastating\n",
        "speed of a hurricane. He sprang, knocked the governor sprawling with a savage blow of his knife hilt,\n",
        "swept up the astounded Devi in one brawny arm and leaped for the window. Chunder Shan, struggling\n",

        "that was his royal captive, and heard his fierce, exultant snarl: \"Now dare to hang my men!\" and then\n",
        "Conan leaped to the parapet and was gone. A wild scream floated back to the governor's ears.\n",
        "\"Guard! Guard!\" screamed the governor, struggling up and running drunkenly to the door. He tore it\n",

        "quivered with the grip of their desperate fingers. Bearded lips parted but no sound came forth. The green\n",
        "cloud rolled on the bars and blotted them from sight; like a fog it oozed through the grille and hid the\n",

        "had escaped her the night before. His garments were clean and not ragged. The broad Bakhariot girdle\n",

        "emblem, but presently something gleamed there--a round, shiny black ball that looked like polished jade.\n",
        "The man in the green turban took this up and tossed it to the Wazuli, who mechanically caught it.\n",
        "\"Carry this to Yar Afzal,\" he said, and the Wazuli turned like an automaton and went back along the path,\n",
        "holding the black jade ball in his outstretched hand. He did not even turn his head to the renewed jeers of\n",
        "the women as he passed the huts. He did not seem to hear.\n",

        "agony burst from his bearded lips; he swayed and fell as if struck by lightning, his right arm tossed out in\n",
        "front of him. Face down he lay, and from between his opening fingers crawled a spider--a hideous, black,\n",
        "hairy-legged monster whose body shone like black jade. The men yelled and gave back suddenly, and the\n",
        "creature scuttled into a crevice of the rocks and disappeared.\n",
        "The warriors started up, glaring wildly, and a voice rose above their clamor, a far-carrying voice of\n",
        "command which came from none knew where. Afterward each man there--who still lived--denied that he\n",
        "had shouted, but all there heard it.\n",

        "closer to him than he was to the door, and with one foot on the sill he had to wheel and parry the swipe\n",
        "of a yard-long blade. He split the man's skull--ducked another swinging knife and gutted the wielder--\n",
        "felled a man with his left fist and stabbed another in the belly--and heaved back mightily against the\n",

        "through the doorway. Conan stopped, grasped the slack of his garments and hauled him clear, and\n",
        "slammed the door in the faces of the men who came surging into it. Bones snapped under the impact, and\n",

        "who sprang from the floor and tore into action like a madman.\n",
        "Yasmina cowered in a corner, staring in horror as the two men fought back and forth across the room,\n",
        "almost trampling her at times; the flash and clangor of their blades filled the room, and outside the mob\n",

        "quivered, but stood still while the man bridled him and clapped on the gold-worked saddle, with the\n",

        "Wheeling the beast around in the stall, Conan called quickly to Yasmina, and the girl came, sidling\n",
        "nervously past the stallion's heels. Conan was working at the stone wall, talking swiftly as he worked.\n",
        "\"A secret door in the wall here, that not even the Wazuli know about. Yar Afzal showed it to me once\n",
        "when he was drunk. It opens out into the mouth of the ravine behind the hut. Ha!\"\n",
        "As he tugged at a projection that seemed casual, a whole section of the wall slid back on oiled iron\n",
        "runners. Looking through, the girl saw a narrow defile opening in a sheer stone cliff within a few feet of\n",
        "the hut's back wall. Then Conan sprang into the saddle and hauled her up before him. Behind them the\n",
        "great door groaned like a living thing and crashed in, and a yell rang to the roof as the entrance was\n",
        "instantly flooded with hairy faces and knives in hairy fists. And then the great stallion went through the\n",
        "wall like a javelin from a catapult, and thundered into the defile, running low, foam flying from the bitrings.\n",
        "That move came as an absolute surprize to the Wazulis. It was a surprize, too, to those stealing down the\n",
        "ravine. It happened so quickly--the hurricane-like charge of the great horse--that a man in a green turban\n",
        "was unable to get out of the way. He went down under the frantic hoofs, and a girl screamed. Conan got\n",
        "one glimpse of her as they thundered by--a slim, dark girl in silk trousers and a jeweled breast-band,\n",
        "flattening herself against the ravine wall. Then the black horse and his riders were gone up the gorge like\n",

        "impatience while the Devi, for the first time in her pampered life, dressed herself. When she stepped from\n",
        "behind the rock he swore in surprize, and she felt a curious rush of emotions at the unrestrained\n",
        "admiration burning in his fierce blue eyes. She felt shame, embarrassment, yet a stimulation of vanity she\n",
        "had never before experienced, and a tingling when meeting the impact of his eyes. He laid a heavy hand\n",

        "He spanked her resoundingly, and she, recognizing this as merely another expression of admiration, did\n",
        "not feel outraged. It was indeed as if the changing of her garments had wrought a change in her\n",

        "lies farther south. This is an ancient one, and seldom used.\"\n",
        "She was staring intently at the distant peak. Her nails bit into her pink palms.\n",
        "\"How long would it take to reach Yimsha from this point?\"\n",
        "\"All the rest of the day, and all night,\" he answered, and grinned. \"Do you want to go there? By Crom, it's\n",
        "no place for an ordinary human, from what the hill-people say.\"\n",
        "\"Why do they not gather and destroy the devils that inhabit it?\" she demanded.\n",
        "\"Wipe out wizards with swords? Anyway, they never interfere with people, unless the people interfere\n",
        "with them. I never saw one of them, though I've talked with men who swore they had. They say they've\n",

        "\"Would you be afraid to attack them?\"\n",
        "\"I?\" The idea seemed a new one to him. \"Why, if they imposed upon me, it would be my life or theirs. But\n",
        "I have nothing to do with them. I came to these mountains to raise a following of human beings, not to\n",

        "Yasmina did not at once reply. She stared at the peak as at a human enemy, feeling all her anger and\n",
        "hatred stir in her bosom anew. And another feeling began to take dim shape. She had plotted to hurl\n",
        "against the masters of Yimsha the man in whose arms she was now carried. Perhaps there was another\n",
        "way, besides the method she had planned, to accomplish her purpose. She could not mistake the look\n",
        "that was beginning to dawn in this wild man's eyes as they rested on her. Kingdoms have fallen when a\n",

        "\"Look!\"\n",
        "Just visible on the distant peak there hung a cloud of peculiar aspect. It was a frosty crimson in color,\n",
        "veined with sparkling gold. This cloud was in motion; it rotated, and as it whirled it contracted. It\n",
        "dwindled to a spinning taper that flashed in the sun. And suddenly it detached itself from the snowtipped peak, floated out over the void like a gay-hued feather, and became invisible against the cerulean\n",

        "\"What could that have been?\" asked the girl uneasily, as a shoulder of rock shut the distant mountain\n",
        "from view; the phenomenon had been disturbing, even in its beauty.\n",

        "that crimson cloud float up from the peak. What in--\"\n",
        "They had advanced through a narrow, knife-cut gash between turreted walls and emerged upon a broad\n",

        "trail followed this ledge, bent around a shoulder and reappeared at intervals far below, working a tedious\n",
        "way downward. And emerging from the cut that opened upon the ledge, the black stallion halted short,\n",

        "Neither of them had seen him come, but he stood there, with his arms folded, a man in a camel-hair robe\n",

        "ravine outside the Wazuli village.\n",
        "\"Who the devil are you?\" he demanded.\n",
        "The man did not answer. Conan noticed that his eyes were wide, fixed, and of a peculiar luminous\n",

        "But Conan was not a son of the East. Its traditions were meaningless to him; he was the product of an\n",

        "They were four tall men, with shaven, vulture-like heads, and black robes that hid their feet. Their hands\n",
        "were concealed by their wide sleeves. They stood in silence, their naked heads nodding slightly in unison.\n",
        "They were facing Khemsa, but behind them Conan felt his own blood turning to ice in his veins. Rising,\n",

        "Conan had witnessed hundreds of battles in his wild life, but never one like this, wherein four diabolical\n",

        "sensed the monstrous quality of that hideous struggle. With his back to the wall, driven to bay by his\n",

        "drunkenly after her, hands vainly outstretched, groaning, slobbering in his pain, his feet moving heavily\n",
        "like dead things.\n",
        "On the very brink she paused, standing stiffly, her heels on the edge, and he fell on his knees and crawled\n",
        "whimpering toward her, groping for her, to drag her back from destruction. And just before his clumsy\n",

        "the necessity of traversing those miles, but it was the only way. To try to descend to the lower lap of the\n",
        "trail here would be to attempt the impossible. Only a bird could get to the riverbed with a whole neck.\n",

        "pushed hard throughout the night, gnawing at scraps from saddle-bags, and pausing only to give the\n",
        "horses the rests they had to have.\n",
        "\"That first tower is held by the acolytes of the Black Seers,\" said Conan. \"Or so men say; watch-dogs for\n",
        "their masters--lesser sorcerers. They won't sit sucking their thumbs as we climb this slope.\"\n",
        "Kerim Shah glanced up the mountain, then back the way they had come; they were already far up\n",
        "Yimsha's side, and a vast expanse of lesser peaks and crags spread out beneath them. Among these\n",
        "labyrinths the Turanian sought in vain for a movement of color that would betray men. Evidently the\n",
        "pursuing Afghulis had lost their chief's trail in the night.\n",
        "\"Let us go, then.\" They tied the weary horses in a clump of tamarisk and without further comment turned\n",
        "up the slope. There was no cover. It was a naked incline, strewn with boulders not big enough to conceal\n",
        "a man. But they did conceal something else.\n",
        "The party had not gone fifty steps when a snarling shape burst from behind a rock. It was one of the\n",
        "gaunt savage dogs that infested the hill villages, and its eyes glared redly, its jaws dripped foam. Conan\n",
        "was leading, but it did not attack him. It dashed past him and leaped at Kerim Shah. The Turanian leaped\n",
        "aside, and the great dog flung itself upon the Irakzai behind him. The man yelled and threw up his arm,\n",
        "which was torn by the brute's fangs as it bore him backward, and the next instant half a dozen tulwars\n",
        "were hacking at the beast. Yet not until it was literally dismembered did the hideous creature cease its\n",
        "efforts to seize and rend its attackers.\n",
        "Kerim Shah bound up the wounded warrior's gashed arm, looked at him narrowly, and then turned\n",
        "away without a word. He rejoined Conan, and they renewed the climb in silence.\n",
        "Presently Kerim Shah said: \"Strange to find a village dog in this place.\"\n",
        "\"There's no offal here,\" grunted Conan.\n",
        "Both turned their heads to glance back at the wounded warrior toiling after them among his companions.\n",
        "Sweat glistened on his dark face and his lips were drawn back from his teeth in a grimace of pain. Then\n",
        "both looked again at the stone tower squatting above them.\n",
        "The People of the Black Circle\n",
        "260\n",
        "A slumberous quiet lay over the uplands. The tower showed no sign of life, nor did the strange\n",
        "pyramidal structure beyond it. But the men who toiled upward went with the tenseness of men walking\n",
        "on the edge of a crater. Kerim Shah had unslung the powerful Turanian bow that killed at five hundred\n",
        "paces, and the Irakzai looked to their own lighter and less lethal bows.\n",
        "But they were not within bow-shot of the tower when something shot down out of the sky without\n",
        "warning. It passed so close to Conan that he felt the wind of rushing wings, but it was an Irakzai who\n",
        "staggered and fell, blood jetting from a severed jugular. A hawk with wings like burnished steel shot up\n",
        "again, blood dripping from the scimitar-beak, to reel against the sky as Kerim Shah's bowstring twanged.\n",
        "It dropped like a plummet, but no man saw where it struck the earth.\n",
        "Conan bent over the victim of the attack, but the man was already dead. No one spoke; useless to\n",
        "comment on the fact that never before had a hawk been known to swoop on a man. Red rage began to vie\n",
        "with fatalistic lethargy in the wild souls of the Irakzai. Hairy fingers nocked arrows and men glared\n",
        "vengefully at the tower whose very silence mocked them.\n",
        "But the next attack came swiftly. They all saw it--a white puffball of smoke that tumbled over the towerrim and came drifting and rolling down the slope toward them. Others followed it. They seemed\n",
        "harmless, mere woolly globes of cloudy foam, but Conan stepped aside to avoid contact with the first.\n",
        "Behind him one of the Irakzai reached out and thrust his sword into the unstable mass. Instantly a sharp\n",
        "report shook the mountainside. There was a burst of blinding flame, and then the puffball had vanished,\n",
        "and the too-curious warrior remained only a heap of charred and blackened bones. The crisped hand still\n",
        "gripped the ivory sword-hilt, but the blade was gone melted and destroyed by that awful heat. Yet men\n",
        "standing almost within reach of the victim had not suffered except to be dazzled and half blinded by the\n",
        "sudden flare.\n",
        "\"Steel touches it off,\" grunted Conan. \"Look out--here they come!\"\n",
        "The slope above them was almost covered by the billowing spheres. Kerim Shah bent his bow and sent a\n",
        "shaft into the mass, and those touched by the arrow burst like bubbles in spurting flame. His men\n",
        "followed his example and for the next few minutes it was as if a thunderstorm raged on the mountain\n",
        "slope, with bolts of lightning striking and bursting in showers of flame. When the barrage ceased, only a\n",
        "few arrows were left in the quivers of the archers.\n",
        "They pushed on grimly, over soil charred and blackened, where the naked rock had in places been turned\n",
        "to lava by the explosion of those diabolical bombs.\n",
        "Now they were almost within arrow-flight of the silent tower, and they spread their line, nerves taut,\n",
        "ready for any horror that might descend upon them.\n",
        "On the tower appeared a single figure, lifting a ten-foot bronze horn. Its strident bellow roared out across\n",
        "the echoing slopes, like the blare of trumpets on judgment Day. And it began to be fearfully answered.\n",
        "The ground trembled under the feet of the invaders, and rumblings and grindings welled up from the\n",
        "subterranean depths.\n",
        "The Irakzai screamed, reeling like drunken men on the shuddering slope, and Conan, eyes glaring,\n",
        "charged recklessly up the incline, knife in hand, straight at the door that showed in the tower-wall. Above \n",
        "The People of the Black Circle\n",
        "261\n",
        "him the great horn roared and bellowed in brutish mockery. And then Kerim Shah drew a shaft to his ear\n",
        "and loosed.\n",
        "Only a Turanian could have made that shot. The bellowing of the horn ceased suddenly, and a high, thin\n",
        "scream shrilled in its place. The green-robed figure on the tower staggered, clutching at the long shaft\n",
        "which quivered in its bosom, and then pitched across the parapet. The great horn tumbled upon the\n",
        "battlement and hung precariously, and another robed figure rushed to seize it, shrieking in horror. Again\n",
        "the Turanian bow twanged, and again it was answered by a death-howl. The second acolyte, in falling,\n",
        "struck the horn with his elbow and knocked it clattering over the parapet to shatter on the rocks far below.\n",
        "At such headlong speed had Conan covered the ground that before the clattering echoes of that fall had\n",
        "died away, he was hacking at the door. Warned by his savage instinct, he gave back suddenly as a tide of\n",
        "molten lead splashed down from above. But the next instant he was back again, attacking the panels with\n",
        "redoubled fury. He was galvanized by the fact that his enemies had resorted to earthly weapons. The\n",
        "sorcery of the acolytes was limited. Their necromantic resources might well be exhausted.\n",
        "Kerim Shah was hurrying up the slope, his hill-men behind him in a straggling crescent. They loosed as\n",
        "they ran, their arrows splintering against the walls or arching over the parapet.\n",
        "The heavy teak portal gave way beneath the Cimmerian's assault, and he peered inside warily, expecting\n",
        "anything. He was looking into a circular chamber from which a stair wound upward. On the opposite\n",
        "side of the chamber a door gaped open, revealing the outer slope--and the backs of half a dozen greenrobed figures in full retreat.\n",
        "Conan yelled, took a step into the tower, and then native caution jerked him back, just as a great block of\n",
        "stone fell crashing to the floor where his foot had been an instant before. Shouting to his followers, he\n",
        "raced around the tower.\n",
        "The acolytes had evacuated their first line of defence. As Conan rounded the tower he saw their green\n",
        "robes twinkling up the mountain ahead of him. He gave chase, panting with earnest blood-lust, and\n",
        "behind him Kerim Shah and the Irakzai came pelting, the latter yelling like wolves at the flight of their\n",
        "enemies, their fatalism momentarily submerged by temporary triumph.\n",
        "The tower stood on the lower edge of a narrow plateau whose upward slant was barely perceptible. A\n",
        "few hundred yards away this plateau ended abruptly in a chasm which had been invisible farther down\n",
        "the mountain. Into this chasm the acolytes apparently leaped without checking their speed. Their\n",
        "pursuers saw the green robes flutter and disappear over the edge.\n",
        "A few moments later they themselves were standing on the brink of the mighty moat that cut them off\n",
        "from the castle of the Black Seers. It was a sheer-walled ravine that extended in either direction as far as\n",
        "they could see, apparently girdling the mountain, some four hundred yards in width and five hundred\n",
        "feet deep. And in it, from rim to rim, a strange, translucent mist sparkled and shimmered.\n",
        "Looking down, Conan grunted. Far below him, moving across the glimmering floor, which shone like\n",
        "burnished silver, he saw the forms of the green-robed acolytes. Their outline was wavering and indistinct,\n",
        "like figures seen under deep water. They walked in single file, moving toward the opposite wall.\n",
        "The People of the Black Circle\n",
        "262\n",
        "Kerim Shah nocked an arrow and sent it singing downward. But when it struck the mist that filled the\n",
        "chasm it seemed to lose momentum and direction, wandering widely from its course.\n",
        "\"If they went down, so can we!\" grunted Conan, while Kerim Shah stared after his shaft in amazement. \"I\n",
        "saw them last at this spot--\"\n",
        "Squinting down he saw something shining like a golden thread across the canyon floor far below. The\n",
        "acolytes seemed to be following this thread, and there suddenly came to him Khemsa's cryptic words--\n",
        "\"Follow the golden vein!\" On the brink, under his very hand as he crouched, he found it, a thin vein of\n",
        "sparkling gold running from an outcropping of ore to the edge and down across the silvery floor. And he\n",
        "found something else, which had before been invisible to him because of the peculiar refraction of the\n",
        "light. The gold vein followed a narrow ramp which slanted down into the ravine, fitted with niches for\n",
        "hand and foot hold.\n",
        "\"Here's where they went down,\" he grunted to Kerim Shah. \"They're no adepts, to waft themselves\n",
        "through the air! We'll follow them--\"\n",
        "It was at that instant that the man who had been bitten by the mad dog cried out horribly and leaped at\n",
        "Kerim Shah, foaming and gnashing his teeth. The Turanian, quick as a cat on his feet, sprang aside and\n",
        "the madman pitched head-first over the brink. The others rushed to the edge and glared after him in\n",
        "amazement. The maniac did not fall plummet-like. He floated slowly down through the rosy haze like a\n",
        "man sinking in deep water. His limbs moved like a man trying to swim, and his features were purple and\n",
        "convulsed beyond the contortions of his madness. Far down at last on the shining floor his body settled\n",
        "and lay still.\n",
        "\"There's death in that chasm,\" muttered Kerim Shah, drawing back from the rosy mist that shimmered\n",
        "almost at his feet. \"What now, Conan?\"\n",
        "\"On!\" answered the Cimmerian grimly. \"Those acolytes are human; if the mist doesn't kill them, it won't\n",
        "kill me.\"\n",
        "He hitched his belt, and his hands touched the girdle Khemsa had given him; he scowled, then smiled\n",
        "bleakly. He had forgotten that girdle; yet thrice had death passed him by to strike another victim.\n",
        "The acolytes had reached the farther wall and were moving up it like great green flies. Letting himself\n",
        "upon the ramp, he descended warily. The rosy cloud lapped about his ankles, ascending as he lowered\n",
        "himself. It reached his knees, his thighs, his waist, his arm-pits. He felt as one feels a thick heavy fog on a\n",
        "damp night. With it lapping about his chin he hesitated, and then ducked under. Instantly his breath\n",
        "ceased; all air was shut off from him and he felt his ribs caving in on his vitals. With a frantic effort he\n",
        "heaved himself up, fighting for life. His head rose above the surface and he drank air in great gulps.\n",
        "Kerim Shah leaned down toward him, spoke to him, but Conan neither heard nor heeded. Stubbornly, his\n",
        "mind fixed on what the dying Khemsa had told him, the Cimmerian groped for the gold vein, and found\n",
        "that he had moved off it in his descent. Several series of hand-holds were niched in the ramp. Placing\n",
        "himself directly over the thread, he began climbing down once more. The rosy mist rose about him,\n",
        "engulfed him. Now his head was under, but he was still drinking pure air. Above him he saw his\n",
        "companions staring down at him, their features blurred by the haze that shimmered over his head. He\n",
        "gestured for them to follow, and went down swiftly, without waiting to see whether they complied or not.\n",
        "The People of the Black Circle\n",
        "263\n",
        "Kerim Shah sheathed his sword without comment and followed, and the Irakzai, more fearful of being\n",
        "left alone than of the terrors that might lurk below, scrambled after him. Each man clung to the golden\n",
        "thread as they saw the Cimmerian do.\n",
        "Down the slanting ramp they went to the ravine floor and moved out across the shining level, treading\n",
        "the gold vein like rope-walkers. It was as if they walked along an invisible tunnel through which air\n",
        "circulated freely. They felt death pressing in on them above and on either hand, but it did not touch them.\n",
        "The vein crawled up a similar ramp on the other wall up which the acolytes had disappeared, and up it\n",
        "they went with taut nerves, not knowing what might be waiting for them among the jutting spurs of rock\n",
        "that fanged the lip of the precipice.\n",
        "It was the green-robed acolytes who awaited them, with knives in their hands. Perhaps they had reached\n",
        "the limits to which they could retreat. Perhaps the Stygian girdle about Conan's waist could have told\n",
        "why their necromantic spells had proven so weak and so quickly exhausted. Perhaps it was knowledge of\n",
        "death decreed for failure that sent them leaping from among the rocks, eyes glaring and knives glittering,\n",
        "resorting in their desperation to material weapons.\n",
        "There among the rocky fangs on the precipice lip was no war of wizard craft. It was a whirl of blades,\n",
        "where real steel bit and real blood spurted, where sinewy arms dealt forthright blows that severed\n",
        "quivering flesh, and men went down to be trodden under foot as the fight raged over them.\n",
        "One of the Irakzai bled to death among the rocks, but the acolytes were down--slashed and hacked\n",
        "asunder or hurled over the edge to float sluggishly down to the silver floor that shone so far below.\n",
        "Then the conquerors shook blood and sweat from their eyes, and looked at one another. Conan and\n",
        "Kerim Shah still stood upright, and four of the Irakzai.\n",
        "They stood among the rocky teeth that serrated the precipice brink, and from that spot a path wound up\n",
        "a gentle slope to a broad stair, consisting of half a dozen steps, a hundred feet across, cut out of a green\n",
        "jade-like substance. They led up to a broad stage or roofless gallery of the same polished stone, and above\n",
        "it rose, tier upon tier, the castle of the Black Seers. It seemed to have been carved out of the sheer stone of\n",
        "the mountain. The architecture was faultless, but unadorned. The many casements were barred and\n",
        "masked with curtains within. There was no sign of life, friendly or hostile.\n",
        "They went up the path in silence, and warily as men treading the lair of a serpent. The Irakzai were dumb,\n",
        "like men marching to a certain doom. Even Kerim Shah was silent. Only Conan seemed unaware what a\n",
        "monstrous dislocating and uprooting of accepted thought and action their invasion constituted, what an\n",
        "unprecedented violation of tradition. He was not of the East; and he came of a breed who fought devils\n",
        "and wizards as promptly and matter-of-factly as they battled human foes.\n",
        "He strode up the shining stairs and across the wide green gallery straight toward the great golden-bound\n",
        "teak door that opened upon it. He cast but a single glance upward at the higher tiers of the great\n",
        "pyramidal structure towering above him. He reached a hand for the bronze prong that jutted like a\n",
        "handle from the door--then checked himself, grinning hardly. The handle was made in the shape of a\n",
        "serpent, head lifted on arched neck; and Conan had a suspicion that that metal head would come to grisly\n",
        "life under his hand.\n",
        "The People of the Black Circle\n",
        "264\n",
        "He struck it from the door with one blow, and its bronze clink on the glassy floor did not lessen his\n",
        "caution. He flipped it aside with his knife-point, and again turned to the door. Utter silence reigned over\n",
        "the towers. Far below them the mountain slopes fell away into a purple haze of distance. The sun\n",
        "glittered on snow-clad peaks on either hand. High above, a vulture hung like a black dot in the cold blue\n",
        "of the sky. But for it, the men before the gold-bound door were the only evidence of life, tiny figures on a\n",
        "green jade gallery poised on the dizzy height, with that fantastic pile of stone towering above them.\n",
        "A sharp wind off the snow slashed them, whipping their tatters about. Conan's long knife splintering\n",
        "through the teak panels roused the startled echoes. Again and again he struck, hewing through polished\n",
        "wood and metal bands alike. Through the sundered ruins he glared into the interior, alert and suspicious\n",
        "as a wolf. He saw a broad chamber, the polished stone walls untapestried, the mosaic floor uncarpeted.\n",
        "Square, polished ebon stools and a stone dais formed the only furnishings. The room was empty of\n",
        "human life. Another door showed in the opposite wall.\n",
        "\"Leave a man on guard outside,\" grunted Conan. \"I'm going in.\"\n",
        "Kerim Shah designated a warrior for that duty, and the man fell back toward the middle of the gallery,\n",
        "bow in hand. Conan strode into the castle, followed by the Turanian and the three remaining Irakzai. The\n",
        "one outside spat, grumbled in his beard, and started suddenly as a low mocking laugh reached his ears.\n",
        "He lifted his head and saw, on the tier above him, a tall, black-robed figure, naked head nodding slightly\n",
        "as he stared down. His whole attitude suggested mockery and malignity. Quick as a flash the Irakzai bent\n",
        "his bow and loosed, and the arrow streaked upward to strike full in the black-robed breast. The mocking\n",
        "smile did not alter. The Seer plucked out the missile and threw it back at the bowman, not as a weapon is\n",
        "hurled, but with a contemptuous gesture. The Irakzai dodged, instinctively throwing up his arm. His\n",
        "fingers closed on the revolving shaft.\n",
        "Then he shrieked. In his hand the wooden shaft suddenly writhed. Its rigid outline became pliant,\n",
        "melting in his grasp. He tried to throw it from him, but it was too late. He held a living serpent in his\n",
        "naked hand, and already it had coiled about his wrist and its wicked wedge-shaped head darted at his\n",
        "muscular arm. He screamed again and his eyes became distended, his features purple. He went to his\n",
        "knees shaken by an awful convulsion, and then lay still.\n",
        "The men inside had wheeled at his first cry. Conan took a swift stride toward the open doorway, and\n",
        "then halted short, baffled. To the men behind him it seemed that he strained against empty air. But\n",
        "though he could see nothing, there was a slick, smooth, hard surface under his hands, and he knew that a\n",
        "sheet of crystal had been let down in the doorway. Through it he saw the Irakzai lying motionless on the\n",
        "glassy gallery, an ordinary arrow sticking in his arm.\n",
        "Conan lifted his knife and smote, and the watchers were dumbfounded to see his blow checked\n",
        "apparently in midair, with the loud clang of steel that meets an unyielding substance. He wasted no more\n",
        "effort. He knew that not even the legendary tulwar of Amir Khurum could shatter that invisible curtain.\n",
        "In a few words he explained the matter to Kerim Shah, and the Turanian shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, if\n",
        "our exit is barred, we must find another. In the meanwhile our way lies forward, does it not?\"\n",
        "With a grunt the Cimmerian turned and strode across the chamber to the opposite door, with a feeling of\n",
        "treading on the threshold of doom. As he lifted his knife to shatter the door, it swung silently open as if of \n",
        "The People of the Black Circle\n",
        "265\n",
        "its own accord. He strode into the great hall, flanked with tall glassy columns. A hundred feet from the\n",
        "door began the broad jade-green steps of a stair that tapered toward the top like the side of a pyramid.\n",
        "What lay beyond that stair he could not tell. But between him and its shimmering foot stood a curious\n",
        "altar of gleaming black jade. Four great golden serpents twined their tails about this altar and reared their\n",
        "wedge-shaped heads in the air, facing the four quarters of the compass like the enchanted guardians of a\n",
        "fabled treasure. But on the altar, between the arching necks, stood only a crystal globe filled with a\n",
        "cloudy smoke-like substance, in which floated four golden pomegranates.\n",
        "The sight stirred some dim recollection in his mind; then Conan heeded the altar no longer, for on the\n",
        "lower steps of the stair stood four black-robed figures. He had not seen them come. They were simply\n",
        "there, tall, gaunt, their vulture-heads nodding in unison, their feet and hands hidden by their flowing\n",
        "garments.\n",
        "One lifted his arm and the sleeve fell away revealing his hand--and it was not a hand at all. Conan halted\n",
        "in mid-stride, compelled against his will. He had encountered a force differing subtly from Khemsa's\n",
        "mesmerism, and he could not advance, though he felt it in his power to retreat if he wished. His\n",
        "companions had likewise halted, and they seemed even more helpless than he, unable to move in either\n",
        "direction.\n",
        "The seer whose arm was lifted beckoned to one of the Irakzai, and the man moved toward him like one in\n",
        "a trance, eyes staring and fixed, blade hanging in limp fingers. As he pushed past Conan, the Cimmerian\n",
        "threw an arm across his breast to arrest him. Conan was so much stronger than the Irakzai that in\n",
        "ordinary circumstances he could have broken his spine between his hands. But now the muscular arm\n",
        "was brushed aside like straw and the Irakzai moved toward the stair, treading jerkily and mechanically.\n",
        "He reached the steps and knelt stiffly, proffering his blade and bending his head. The Seer took the sword.\n",
        "It flashed as he swung it up and down. The Irakzai's head tumbled from his shoulders and thudded\n",
        "heavily on the black marble floor. An arch of blood jetted from the severed arteries and the body slumped\n",

        "that he could not doubt his instinct. His left hand slid involuntarily under his Bakhariot belt and closed\n",
        "on the Stygian girdle. And as he gripped it he felt new strength flood his numbed limbs; the will to live\n",
        "was a pulsing white-hot fire, matched by the intensity of his burning rage.\n",
        "The third Irakzai was a decapitated corpse, and the hideous finger was lifting again when Conan felt the\n",

        "move. They watched calmly, cynically; if they felt surprise they did not show it. Conan did not allow\n",
        "himself to think what might chance when he came within knife-reach of them. His blood was pounding\n",
        "in his temples, a mist of crimson swam before his sight. He was afire with the urge to kill--to drive his\n",

        "external ear, the cryptic words of Khemsa: \"Break the crystal ball.\"\n",
        "His reaction was almost without his own volition. Execution followed impulse so spontaneously that the\n",

        "like a cat from his headlong charge, he brought his knife crashing down upon the crystal. Instantly the air\n",
        "vibrated with a peal of terror, whether from the stairs, the altar, or the crystal itself he could not tell.\n",
        "Hisses filled his ears as the golden serpents, suddenly vibrant with hideous life, writhed and smote at\n",

        "with a noise like a thunderclap, raining fiery shards on the black marble, and the gold pomegranates, as if\n",
        "released from captivity, shot upward toward the lofty roof and were gone.\n",
        "A mad screaming, bestial and ghastly, was echoing through the great hall. On the steps writhed four\n",
        "black-robed figures, twisting in convulsions, froth dripping from their livid mouths. Then with one\n",
        "frenzied crescendo of inhuman ululation they stiffened and lay still, and Conan knew that they were\n",
        "dead. He stared down at the altar and the crystal shards. Four headless golden serpents still coiled about\n",
        "the altar, but no alien life now animated the dully gleaming metal.\n",
        "Kerim Shah was rising slowly from his knees, whither he had been dashed by some unseen force. He\n",

        "snapping of mail-links, his breast burst outward with a shower of blood, and through the ghastly\n",
        "aperture something red and dripping shot through the air into the Master's outstretched hand, as a bit of \n",

        "steel leaps to the magnet. The Turanian slumped to the floor and lay motionless, and the Master laughed\n",

        "Now he had reached the head of the stairs, and the Master's face floated in the steely haze before him,\n",
        "and a strange fear shadowed the inscrutable eyes. Conan waded through the mist as through a surf, and\n",
        "his knife lunged upward like a live thing. The keen point ripped the Master's robe as he sprang back with\n",
        "a low cry. Then before Conan's gaze, the wizard vanished--simply disappeared like a burst bubble, and\n",
        "something long and undulating darted up one of the smaller stairs that led up to left and right from the\n",
        "landing.\n",
        "Conan charged after it, up the left-hand stair, uncertain as to just what he had seen whip up those steps,\n",

        "From within the chamber rose a scream of urgent terror. The sound lent wings to Conan's flying feet and\n",
        "he hurtled through the curtains and headlong into the chamber within.\n",
        "A frightful scene met his glare. Yasmina cowered on the farther edge of a velvet-covered dais, screaming\n",
        "her loathing and horror, an arm lifted as if to ward off attack, while before her swayed the hideous head\n",
        "of a giant serpent, shining neck arching up from dark-gleaming coils. With a choked cry Conan threw his\n",
        "knife.\n",
        "Instantly the monster whirled and was upon him like the rush of wind through tall grass. The long knife\n",
        "quivered in its neck, point and a foot of blade showing on one side, and the hilt and a hand's-breadth of\n",
        "steel on the other, but it only seemed to madden the giant reptile. The great head towered above the man\n",
        "who faced it, and then darted down, the venom-dripping jaws gaping wide. But Conan had plucked a\n",
        "dagger from his girdle and he stabbed upward as the head dipped down. The point tore through the\n",
        "lower jaw and transfixed the upper, pinning them together. The next instant the great trunk had looped\n",
        "itself about the Cimmerian as the snake, unable to use its fangs, employed its remaining form of attack.\n",
        "Conan's left arm was pinioned among the bone-crushing folds, but his right was free. Bracing his feet to\n",
        "keep upright, he stretched forth his hand, gripped the hilt of the long knife jutting from the serpent's neck,\n",
        "and tore it free in a shower of blood. As if divining his purpose with more than bestial intelligence, the\n",
        "snake writhed and knotted, seeking to cast its loops about his right arm. But with the speed of light the\n",

        "The People of the Black Circle\n",
        "268\n",
        "Before he could strike again, the great pliant loops fell from him and the monster dragged itself across the\n",

        "empty air as the serpent writhed away from him and struck its blunt nose against a paneled screen of\n",
        "sandalwood. One of the panels gave inward and the long, bleeding barrel whipped through it and was\n",
        "gone.\n",
        "Conan instantly attacked the screen. A few blows rent it apart and he glared into the dim alcove beyond.\n",
        "No horrific shape coiled there; there was blood on the marble floor, and bloody tracks led to a cryptic\n",
        "arched door. Those tracks were of a man's bare feet . . .\n",
        "\"Conan!\" He wheeled back into the chamber just in time to catch the Devi of Vendhya in his arms as she\n",

        "hysterical with terror and gratitude and relief.\n",
        "His wild blood had been stirred to its uttermost by all that had passed. He caught her to him in a grasp\n",
        "that would have made her wince at another time, and crushed her lips with his. She made no resistance;\n",
        "the Devi was drowned in the elemental woman. She closed her eyes and drank in his fierce, hot, lawless\n",
        "kisses with all the abandon of passionate thirst. She was panting with his violence when he ceased for\n",
        "breath, and glared down at her lying limp in his mighty arms.\n",
        "\"I knew you'd come for me,\" she murmured. \"You would not leave me in this den of devils.\"\n",
        "At her words recollection of their environment came to him suddenly. He lifted his head and listened\n",
        "intently. Silence reigned over the castle of Yimsha, but it was a silence impregnated with menace. Peril\n",
        "crouched in every corner, leered invisibly from every hanging.\n",
        "\"We'd better go while we can,\" he muttered. \"Those cuts were enough to kill any common beast--or man--\n",
        "but a wizard has a dozen lives. Wound one, and he writhes away like a crippled snake to soak up fresh\n",
        "venom from some source of sorcery.\"\n",
        "He picked up the girl and carrying her in his arms like a child, he strode out into the gleaming jade\n",
        "corridor and down the stairs, nerves tautly alert for any sign or sound.\n",
        "\"I met the Master,\" she whispered, clinging to him and shuddering. \"He worked his spells on me to break\n",
        "my will. The most awful thing was a moldering corpse which seized me in its arms--I fainted then and\n",
        "lay as one dead, I do not know how long. Shortly after I regained consciousness I heard sounds of strife\n",
        "below, and cries, and then that snake came slithering through the curtains--ah!\" She shook at the memory\n",
        "of that horror. \"I knew somehow that it was not an illusion, but a real serpent that sought my life.\"\n",
        "\"It was not a shadow, at least,\" answered Conan cryptically. \"He knew he was beaten, and chose to slay\n",
        "you rather than let you be rescued.\"\n",
        "\"What do you mean, he?\" she asked uneasily, and then shrank against him, crying out, and forgetting her\n",
        "question. She had seen the corpses at the foot of the stairs. Those of the Seers were not good to look at; as\n",
        "they lay twisted and contorted, their hands and feet were exposed to view, and at the sight Yasmina went\n",

        "that led upon the gallery. Then he saw the floor sprinkled with tiny, glittering shards. The crystal sheet\n",
        "that had covered the doorway had been shivered to bits, and he remembered the crash that had\n",
        "accompanied the shattering of the crystal globe. He believed that every piece of crystal in the castle had\n",
        "broken at that instant, and some dim instinct or memory of esoteric lore vaguely suggested the truth of\n",
        "the monstrous connection between the Lords of the Black Circle and the golden pomegranates. He felt the\n",
        "short hair bristle chilly at the back of his neck and put the matter hastily out of his mind.\n",
        "He breathed a deep sigh of relief as he stepped out upon the green jade gallery. There was still the gorge\n",
        "to cross, but at least he could see the white peaks glistening in the sun, and the long slopes falling away\n",
        "into the distant blue hazes.\n",
        "The Irakzai lay where he had fallen, an ugly blotch on the glassy smoothness. As Conan strode down the\n",
        "winding path, he was surprised to note the position of the sun. It had not yet passed its zenith; and yet it\n",
        "seemed to him that hours had passed since he plunged into the castle of the Black Seers.\n",
        "He felt an urge to hasten, not a mere blind panic, but an instinct of peril growing behind his back. He said\n",
        "nothing to Yasmina, and she seemed content to nestle her dark head against his arching breast and find\n",
        "security in the clasp of his iron arms. He paused an instant on the brink of the chasm, frowning down.\n",
        "The haze which danced in the gorge was no longer rose-hued and sparkling. It was smoky, dim, ghostly,\n",
        "like the life-tide that flickered thinly in a wounded man. The thought came vaguely to Conan that the\n",
        "spells of magicians were more closely bound to their personal beings than were the actions of common\n",
        "men to the actors.\n",
        "But far below, the floor shone like tarnished silver, and the gold thread sparkled undimmed. Conan\n",
        "shifted Yasmina across his shoulder, where she lay docilely, and began the descent. Hurriedly he\n",
        "descended the ramp, and hurriedly he fled across the echoing floor. He had a conviction that they were\n",
        "racing with time, that their chances of survival depended upon crossing that gorge of horrors before the\n",
        "wounded Master of the castle should regain enough power to loose some other doom upon them.\n",
        "When he toiled up the farther ramp and came out upon the crest, he breathed a gusty sigh of relief and\n",
        "stood Yasmina upon her feet.\n",
        "\"You walk from here,\" he told her; \"it's downhill all the way.\"\n",
        "She stole a glance at the gleaming pyramid across the chasm; it reared up against the snowy slope like the\n",
        "citadel of silence and immemorial evil.\n",
        "\"Are you a magician, that you have conquered the Black Seers of Yimsha, Conan of Ghor?\" she asked, as\n",
        "they went down the path, with his heavy arm about her supple waist.\n",
        "The People of the Black Circle\n",
        "270\n",
        "\"It was a girdle Khemsa gave me before he died,\" Conan answered. \"Yes, I found him on the trail. It is a\n",
        "curious one, which I'll show you when I have time. Against some spells it was weak, but against others it\n",
        "was strong, and a good knife is always a hearty incantation.\"\n",
        "\"But if the girdle aided you in conquering the Master,\" she argued, \"why did it not aid Khemsa?\"\n",
        "He shook his head. \"Who knows? But Khemsa had been the Master's slave; perhaps that weakened its\n",
        "magic. He had no hold on me as he had on Khemsa. Yet I can't say that I conquered him. He retreated,\n",
        "but I have a feeling that we haven't seen the last of him. I want to put as many miles between us and his\n",
        "lair as we can.\"\n",
        "He was further relieved to find horses tethered among the tamarisks as he had left them. He loosed them\n",
        "swiftly and mounted the black stallion, swinging the girl up before him. The others followed, freshened\n",
        "by their rest.\n",
        "\"And what now?\" she asked. \"To Afghulistan?\"\n",
        "\"Not just now!\" He grinned hardly. \"Somebody--maybe the governor--killed my seven headmen. My\n",
        "idiotic followers think I had something to do with it, and unless I am able to convince them otherwise,\n",
        "they'll hunt me like a wounded jackal.\"\n",
        "\"Then what of me? If the headmen are dead, I am useless to you as a hostage. Will you slay me, to avenge\n",
        "them?\"\n",
        "He looked down at her, with eyes fiercely aglow, and laughed at the suggestion.\n",
        "\"Then let us ride to the border,\" she said. \"You'll be safe from the Afghulis there--\"\n",
        "\"Yes, on a Vendhyan gibbet.\"\n",
        "\"I am Queen of Vendhya,\" she reminded him with a touch of her old imperiousness. \"You have saved my\n",
        "life. You shall be rewarded.\"\n",
        "She did not intend it as it sounded, but he growled in his throat, ill pleased.\n",
        "\"Keep your bounty for your city-bred dogs, princess! If you're a queen of the plains, I'm a chief of the hills,\n",
        "and not one foot toward the border will I take you!\"\n",
        "\"But you would be safe--\" she began bewilderedly.\n",
        "\"And you'd be the Devi again,\" he broke in. \"No, girl; I prefer you as you are now--a woman of flesh and\n",
        "blood, riding on my saddle-bow.\"\n",
        "\"But you can't keep me!\" she cried. \"You can't--\"\n",
        "\"Watch and see!\" he advised grimly.\n",
        "\"But I will pay you a vast ransom--\"\n",
        "The People of the Black Circle\n",
        "271\n",
        "\"Devil take your ransom!\" he answered roughly, his arms hardening about her supple figure. \"The\n",
        "kingdom of Vendhya could give me nothing I desire half so much as I desire you. I took you at the risk of\n",
        "my neck; if your courtiers want you back, let them come up the Zhaibar and fight for you.\"\n",
        "\"But you have no followers now!\" she protested. \"You are hunted! How can you preserve your own life,\n",
        "much less mine?\"\n",
        "\"I still have friends in the hills,\" he answered. \"There is a chief of the Khurakzai who will keep you safely\n",
        "while I bicker with the Afghulis. If they will have none of me, by Crom! I will ride northward with you to\n",
        "the steppes of the kozaki. I was a hetman among the Free Companions before I rode southward. I'll make\n",
        "you a queen on the Zaporoska River!\"\n",
        "\"But I can not!\" she objected. \"You must not hold me--\"\n",
        "\"If the idea's so repulsive,\" he demanded, \"why did you yield your lips to me so willingly?\"\n",
        "\"Even a queen is human,\" she answered, coloring. \"But because I am a queen, I must consider my\n",
        "kingdom. Do not carry me away into some foreign country. Come back to Vendhya with me!\"\n",
        "\"Would you make me your king?\" he asked sardonically.\n",
        "\"Well, there are customs--\" she stammered, and he interrupted her with a hard laugh.\n",
        "\"Yes, civilized customs that won't let you do as you wish. You'll marry some withered old king of the\n",
        "plains, and I can go my way with only the memory of a few kisses snatched from your lips. Ha!\"\n",
        "\"But I must return to my kingdom!\" she repeated helplessly.\n",
        "\"Why?\" he demanded angrily. \"To chafe your rump on gold thrones, and listen to the plaudits of\n",
        "smirking, velvet-skirted fools? Where is the gain? Listen: I was born in the Cimmerian hills where the\n",
        "people are all barbarians. I have been a mercenary soldier, a corsair, a kozak, and a hundred other things.\n",
        "What king has roamed the countries, fought the battles, loved the women, and won the plunder that I\n",
        "have?\n",
        "\"I came into Ghulistan to raise a horde and plunder the kingdoms to the south--your own among them.\n",
        "Being chief of the Afghulis was only a start. If I can conciliate them, I'll have a dozen tribes following me\n",
        "within a year. But if I can't I'll ride back to the steppes and loot the Turanian borders with the kozaki. And\n",
        "you'll go with me. To the devil with your kingdom; they fended for themselves before you were born.\"\n",
        "She lay in his arms looking up at him, and she felt a tug at her spirit, a lawless, reckless urge that matched\n",
        "his own and was by it called into being. But a thousand generations of sovereignship rode heavy upon\n",
        "her.\n",
        "\"I can't! I can't!\" she repeated helplessly.\n",
        "\"You haven't any choice,\" he assured her. \"You--what the devil!\"\n",
        "They had left Yimsha some miles behind them, and were riding along a high ridge that separated two\n",
        "deep valleys. They had just topped a steep crest where they could gaze down into the valley on their \n",
        "The People of the Black Circle\n",
        "272\n",
        "right hand. And there was a running fight in progress. A strong wind was blowing away from them,\n",
        "carrying the sound from their ears, but even so the clashing of steel and thunder of hoofs welled up from\n",
        "far below.\n",
        "They saw the glint of the sun on lance-tip and spired helmet. Three thousand mailed horsemen were\n",
        "driving before them a ragged band of turbaned riders, who fled snarling and striking like fleeing wolves.\n",
        "\"Turanians,\" muttered Conan. \"Squadrons from Secunderam. What the devil are they doing here?\"\n",
        "\"Who are the men they pursue?\" asked Yasmina. \"And why do they fall back so stubbornly? They can not\n",
        "stand against such odds.\"\n",
        "\"Five hundred of my mad Afghulis,\" he growled, scowling down into the vale. \"They're in a trap, and\n",
        "they know it.\"\n",
        "The valley was indeed a cul-de-sac at that end. It narrowed to a high-walled gorge, opening out further\n",
        "into a round bowl, completely rimmed with lofty, unscalable walls.\n",
        "The turbaned riders were being forced into this gorge, because there was nowhere else for them to go,\n",
        "and they went reluctantly, in a shower of arrows and a whirl of swords. The helmeted riders harried\n",

        "hair, which grew far back from his high, narrow forehead, was black as a raven. His dark eyes were\n",
        "penetrating and alert, the hardness of his thin lips not softened by his thin black mustache. His boots\n",
        "were of Kordavan leather, his hose and doublet of plain, dark silk, tarnished with the wear of the camps\n",
        "and the stains of armor rust.\n",

        "since Constantius entered the kingdom. I don't understand it, and neither does anyone else, but I heard\n",

        "thousand of the blue-bearded devils, fully armed, and people's heads were thrust out of every window\n",
        "and door on the square. The streets leading into the square were thronged by bewildered folk. Taramis\n",

        "royal consort. She did not explain why she had brought the Shemites into the city so treacherously. But\n",
        "she said that, as Constantius had control of a body of professional fighting-men, the army of Khauran\n",
        "would no longer be needed, and therefore she disbanded it, and ordered us to go quietly to our homes.\n",
        "\"Why, obedience to our queen is second nature to us, but we were struck dumb and found no word to\n",

        "shouted to the guardsmen to stand as they were until they received an order from him--and such is his\n",
        "dominance of his men, that they obeyed in spite of the queen. He strode up to the palace steps and glared\n",

        "shouted to cut the traitors down. We were not traitors!\" Despair and bewilderment shook his voice. The\n",
        "girl murmured pityingly, not understanding it all, but aching in sympathy with her lover's suffering.\n",
        "\"The people did not know which side to take. It was a madhouse of confusion and bewilderment. We\n",
        "who fought didn't have a chance, in no formation, without armor and only half armed. The guards were\n",
        "fully armed and drawn up in a square, but there were only five hundred of them. They took a heavy toll\n",
        "before they were cut down, but there could be only one conclusion to such a battle. And while her people\n",
        "were being slaughtered before her, Taramis stood on the palace steps, with Constantius's arm about her\n",
        "waist, and laughed like a heartless, beautiful fiend! Gods, it's all mad--mad!\n",
        "\"I never saw a man fight as Conan fought. He put his back to the courtyard wall, and before they\n",
        "overpowered him the dead men were strewn in heaps thigh-deep about him. But at last they dragged\n",
        "him down, a hundred against one. When I saw him fall I dragged myself away feeling as if the world had\n",
        "burst under my very fingers. I heard Constantius call to his dogs to take the captain alive--stroking his\n",
        "mustache, with that hateful smile on his lips!\"\n",
        "That smile was on the lips of Constantius at that very moment. He sat his horse among a cluster of his\n",
        "men--thick-bodied Shemites with curled blue-black beards and hooked noses; the low-swinging sun\n",
        "struck glints from their peaked helmets and the silvered scales of their corselets. Nearly a mile behind,\n",
        "the walls and towers of Khauran rose sheer out of the meadowlands.\n",
        "By the side of the caravan road a heavy cross had been planted, and on this grim tree a man hung, nailed\n",
        "there by iron spikes through his hands and feet. Naked but for a loin-cloth, the man was almost a giant in\n",
        "stature, and his muscles stood out in thick corded ridges on limbs and body, which the sun had long ago\n",
        "burned brown. The perspiration of agony beaded his face and his mighty breast, but from under the \n",
        "A Witch Shall Be Born\n",
        "284\n",
        "tangled black mane that fell over his low, broad forehead, his blue eyes blazed with an unquenched fire.\n",
        "Blood oozed sluggishly from the lacerations in his hands and feet.\n",
        "Constantius saluted him mockingly.\n",
        "\"I am sorry, captain,\" he said, \"that I cannot remain to ease your last hours, but I have duties to perform in\n",
        "yonder city--I must not keep your delicious queen waiting!\" He laughed softly. \"So I leave you to your\n",
        "own devices--and those beauties!\" He pointed meaningly at the black shadows which swept incessantly\n",
        "back and forth, high above.\n",
        "\"Were it not for them, I imagine that a powerful brute like yourself should live on the cross for days. Do\n",
        "not cherish any illusions of rescue because I am leaving you unguarded. I have had it proclaimed that\n",
        "anyone seeking to take your body, living or dead, from the cross, will be flayed alive together with all the\n",
        "members of his family, in the public square. I am so firmly established in Khauran that my order is as\n",
        "good as a regiment of guardsmen. I am leaving no guard, because the vultures will not approach as long\n",
        "as anyone is near, and I do not wish them to feel any constraint. That is also why I brought you so far\n",
        "from the city. These desert vultures approach the walls no closer than this spot.\n",
        "\"And so, brave captain, farewell! I will remember you when, in an hour, Taramis lies in my arms.\"\n",
        "Blood started afresh from the pierced palms as the victim's mallet-like fists clenched convulsively on the\n",
        "spike-heads. Knots and bunches of muscle started out of the massive arms, and Conan beat his head\n",
        "forward and spat savagely at Constantius's face. The voivode laughed coolly, wiped the saliva from his\n",
        "gorget and reined his horse about.\n",
        "\"Remember me when the vultures are tearing at your living flesh,\" he called mockingly. \"The desert\n",
        "scavengers are a particularly voracious breed. I have seen men hang for hours on a cross, eyeless, earless,\n",
        "and scalpless, before the sharp beaks had eaten their way into their vitals.\"\n",
        "Without a backward glance he rode toward the city, a supple, erect figure, gleaming in his burnished\n",
        "armor, his stolid, bearded henchmen jogging beside him. A faint rising of dust from the worn trail\n",
        "marked their passing.\n",
        "The man hanging on the cross was the one touch of sentient life in a landscape that seemed desolate and\n",
        "deserted in the late evening. Khauran, less than a mile away, might have been on the other side of the\n",
        "world, and existing in another age.\n",
        "Shaking the sweat out of his eyes, Conan stared blankly at the familiar terrain. On either side of the city,\n",
        "and beyond it, stretched the fertile meadowlands, with cattle browsing in the distance where fields and\n",
        "vineyards checkered the plain. The western and northern horizons were dotted with villages, miniature\n",
        "in the distance. A lesser distance to the southeast a silvery gleam marked the course of a river, and\n",
        "beyond that river sandy desert began abruptly to stretch away and away beyond the horizon. Conan\n",
        "stared at that expanse of empty waste shimmering tawnily in the late sunlight as a trapped hawk stares at\n",
        "the open sky. A revulsion shook him when he glanced at the gleaming towers of Khauran. The city had\n",
        "betrayed him--trapped him into circumstances that left him hanging to a wooden cross like a hare nailed\n",

        "universe contracted, focused, became incorporated in the four iron spikes that held him from life and\n",
        "freedom. His great muscles quivered, knotting like iron cables. With the sweat starting out on his graying\n",
        "skin, he sought to gain leverage, to tear the nails from the wood. It was useless. They had been driven\n",
        "deep. Then he tried to tear his hands off the spikes, and it was not the knifing, abysmal agony that finally\n",
        "caused him to cease his efforts, but the futility of it. The spike-heads were broad and heavy; he could not\n",
        "drag them through the wounds. A surge of helplessness shook the giant, for the first time in his life. He\n",
        "hung motionless, his head resting on his breast, shutting his eyes against the aching glare of the sun.\n",
        "A beat of wings caused him to look, just as a feathered shadow shot down out of the sky. A keen beak,\n",
        "stabbing at his eyes, cut his cheek, and he jerked his head aside, shutting his eyes involuntarily. He\n",
        "shouted, a croaking, desperate shout of menace, and the vultures swerved away and retreated, frightened\n",
        "by the sound. They resumed their wary circling above his head. Blood trickled over Conan's mouth, and\n",
        "he licked his lips involuntarily, spat at the salty taste.\n",
        "Thirst assailed him savagely. He had drunk deeply of wine the night before, and no water had touched\n",
        "his lips since before the battle in the square, that dawn. And killing was thirsty, salt-sweaty work. He\n",
        "glared at the distant river as a man in hell glares through the opened grille. He thought of gushing\n",
        "freshets of white water he had breasted, laved to the shoulders in liquid jade. He remembered great horns\n",
        "of foaming ale, jacks of sparkling wine gulped carelessly or spilled on the tavern floor. He bit his lip to\n",
        "keep from bellowing in intolerable anguish as a tortured animal bellows.\n",
        "The sun sank, a lurid ball in a fiery sea of blood. Against a crimson rampart that banded the horizon the\n",
        "towers of the city floated unreal as a dream. The very sky was tinged with blood to his misted glare. He\n",
        "licked his blackened lips and stared with bloodshot eyes at the distant river. It too seemed crimson with\n",
        "blood, and the shadows crawling up from the east seemed black as ebony.\n",
        "In his dulled ears sounded the louder beat of wings. Lifting his head he watched with the burning glare\n",
        "of a wolf the shadows wheeling above him. He knew that his shouts would frighten them away no longer.\n",
        "One dipped--dipped--lower and lower. Conan drew his head back as far as he could, waiting with\n",
        "terrible patience. The vulture swept in with a swift roar of wings. Its beak flashed down, ripping the skin\n",
        "on Conan's chin as he jerked his head aside; then before the bird could flash away, Conan's head lunged\n",
        "forward on his mighty neck muscles, and his teeth, snapping like those of a wolf, locked on the bare,\n",
        "wattled neck.\n",
        "Instantly the vulture exploded into squawking, flapping hysteria. Its thrashing wings blinded the man,\n",
        "and its talons ripped his chest. But grimly he hung on, the muscles starting out in lumps on his jaws. And\n",
        "the scavenger's neck bones crunched between those powerful teeth. With a spasmodic flutter the bird\n",
        "hung limp. Conan let go, spat blood from his mouth. The other vultures, terrified by the fate of their\n",
        "companion, were in full flight to a distant tree, where they perched like black demons in conclave.\n",
        "Ferocious triumph surged through Conan's numbed brain. Life beat strongly and savagely through his\n",

        "death.\n",

        "he was not a Shemite. The dust was not so thick, nor Conan's hawk-like sight so clouded, that he could\n",
        "not perceive the man's facial characteristics.\n",
        "He was as tall as Conan, though not so heavy-limbed. His shoulders were broad and his supple figure\n",
        "was hard as steel and whalebone. A short black beard did not altogether mask the aggressive jut of his\n",
        "lean jaw, and gray eyes cold and piercing as a sword gleamed from the shadow of the kafieh. Quieting\n",
        "his restless steed with a quick, sure hand, this man spoke: \"By Mitra, I should know this man!\"\n",
        "\"Aye!\" It was the guttural accents of a Zuagir. \"It is the Cimmerian who was captain of the queen's\n",
        "guard!\"\n",
        "\"She must be casting off all her old favorites,\" muttered the rider. \"Who'd have ever thought it of Queen\n",

        "As it is we've come this close to the walls and found only this nag\"--he glanced at a fine gelding led by\n",
        "one of the nomads--\"and this dying dog.\"\n",
        "Conan lifted his bloody head.\n",
        "\"If I could come down from this beam I'd make a dying dog out of you, you Zaporoskan thief!\" he rasped\n",

        "\"Mitra, the knave knows me!\" exclaimed the other. \"How, knave, do you know me?\"\n",
        "\"There's only one of your breed in these parts,\" muttered Conan. \"You are Olgerd Vladislav, the outlaw\n",

        "\"There's no limit to what we may accomplish! We have eleven thousand men now. In another year we\n",

        "\"You told me once you'd aid me in taking Khauran,\" said Conan.\n",
        "\"Yes, but that was before I began to see the full possibilities of our power,\" answered Olgerd. \"I was only\n",
        "thinking of the loot in the city. I don't want to waste our strength unprofitably. Khauran is too strong a\n",

        "\"Within the week,\" answered Conan, and the kozak stared at the certainty in his voice.\n",
        "\"Listen,\" said Olgerd, \"even if I were willing to throw away men on such a hare-brained attempt--what\n",
        "could you expect? Do you think these wolves could besiege and take a city like Khauran?\"\n",
        "\"There'll be no siege,\" answered the Cimmerian. \"I know how to draw Constantius out into the plain.\"\n",
        "\"And what then?\" cried Olgerd with an oath. \"In the arrowplay our horsemen would have the worst of it,\n",
        "for the armor of the asshuri is the better, and when it came to sword-strokes their close-marshaled ranks\n",
        "of trained swordsmen would cleave through our loose lines and scatter our men like chaff before the\n",

        "\"And where would you secure three thousand Hyborians?\" asked Olgerd with vast sarcasm. \"Will you\n",
        "conjure them out of the air?\"\n",
        "A Witch Shall Be Born\n",
        "295\n",
        "\"I have them,\" answered the Cimmerian imperturbably. \"Three thousand men of Khauran camp at the\n",

        "\"What?\" Olgerd glared like a startled wolf.\n",
        "\"Aye. Men who had fled from the tyranny of Constantius. Most of them have been living the lives of\n",
        "outlaws in the deserts east of Khauran, and are gaunt and hard and desperate as man-eating tigers. One\n",
        "of them will be a match for any three squat mercenaries. It takes oppression and hardship to stiffen men's\n",
        "guts and put the fire of hell into their thews. They were broken up into small bands; all they needed was\n",

        "at my disposal.\"\n",
        "\"All this without my knowledge?\" A feral light began to gleam in Olgerd's eye. He hitched at his weapongirdle.\n",
        "\"It was I they wished to follow, not you.\"\n",
        "\"And what did you tell these outcasts to gain their allegiance?\" There was a dangerous ring in Olgerd's\n",
        "voice.\n",
        "\"I told them that I'd use this horde of desert wolves to help them destroy Constantius and give Khauran\n",
        "back into the hands of its citizens.\"\n",
        "\"You fool!\" whispered Olgerd. \"Do you deem yourself chief already?\"\n",
        "The men were on their feet, facing each other across the ebony board, devil-lights dancing in Olgerd's\n",
        "cold gray eyes, a grim smile on the Cimmerian's hard lips.\n",
        "\"I'll have you torn between four palm-trees,\" said the kozak calmly.\n",
        "\"Call the men and bid them do it!\" challenged Conan. \"See if they obey you!\"\n",
        "Baring his teeth in a snarl, Olgerd lifted his hand--then paused. There was something about the\n",
        "confidence in the Cimmerian's dark face that shook him. His eyes began to burn like those of a wolf.\n",
        "\"You scum of the western hills,\" he muttered, \"have you dared seek to undermine my power?\"\n",
        "\"I didn't have to,\" answered Conan. \"You lied when you said I had nothing to do with bringing in the\n",
        "new recruits. I had everything to do with it. They took your orders, but they fought for me. There is not\n",
        "room for two chiefs of the Zuagirs. They know I am the stronger man. I understand them better than you,\n",
        "and they, me; because I am a barbarian too.\"\n",
        "\"And what will they say when you ask them to fight for Khauran?\" asked Olgerd sardonically.\n",
        "\"They'll follow me. I'll promise them a camel-train of gold from the palace. Khauran will be willing to pay\n",
        "that as a guerdon for getting rid of Constantius. After that, I'll lead them against the Turanians as you\n",
        "have planned. They want loot, and they'd as soon fight Constantius for it as anybody.\"\n",
        "In Olgerd's eyes grew a recognition of defeat. In his red dreams of empire he had missed what was going\n",
        "on about him. Happenings and events that had seemed meaningless before now flashed into his mind, \n",
        "A Witch Shall Be Born\n",
        "296\n",
        "with their true significance, bringing a realization that Conan spoke no idle boast. The giant black-mailed\n",
        "figure before him was the real chief of the Zuagirs.\n",
        "\"Not if you die!\" muttered Olgerd, and his hand flickered toward his hilt. But quick as the stroke of a\n",
        "great cat, Conan's arm shot across the table and his fingers locked on Olgerd's forearm. There was a snap\n",
        "of breaking bones, and for a tense instant the scene held: the men facing each other as motionless as\n",
        "images, perspiration starting out on Olgerd's forehead. Conan laughed, never easing his grip on the\n",
        "broken arm.\n",
        "\"Are you fit to live, Olgerd?\"\n",
        "His smile did not alter as the corded muscles rippled in knotting ridges along his forearm and his fingers\n",
        "ground into the kozak's quivering flesh. There was the sound of broken bones grating together and\n",
        "Olgerd's face turned the color of ashes; blood oozed from his lip where his teeth sank, but he uttered no\n",
        "sound.\n",
        "With a laugh Conan released him and drew back, and the kozak swayed, caught the table edge with his\n",
        "good hand to steady himself.\n",
        "\"I give you life, Olgerd, as you gave it to me,\" said Conan tranquilly, \"though it was for your own ends\n",
        "that you took me down from the cross. It was a bitter test you gave me then; you couldn't have endured it;\n",
        "neither could anyone, but a western barbarian.\n",
        "\"Take your horse and go. It's tied behind the tent, and food and water are in the saddle-bags. None will\n",
        "see your going, but go quickly. There's no room for a fallen chief on the desert. If the warriors see you,\n",
        "maimed and deposed, they'll never let you leave the camp alive.\"\n",
        "Olgerd did not reply. Slowly, without a word, he turned and stalked across the tent, through the flapped\n",
        "opening. Unspeaking he climbed into the saddle of the great white stallion that stood tethered there in\n",
        "the shade of a spreading palm-tree; and unspeaking, with his broken arm thrust in the bosom of his\n",
        "khalat, he reined the steed about and rode eastward into the open desert, out of the life of the people of\n",
        "the Zuagir.\n",
        "Inside the tent Conan emptied the wine-jug and smacked his lips with relish. Tossing the empty vessel\n",
        "into a corner, he braced his belt and strode out through the front opening, halting for a moment to let his\n",
        "gaze sweep over the lines of camel-hair tents that stretched before him, and the white-robed figures that\n",
        "moved among them, arguing, singing, mending bridles or whetting tulwars.\n",
        "He lifted his voice in a thunder that carried to the farthest confines of the encampment: \"Aie, you dogs,\n",

        "number. They were young men, but hard and sinewy, with a bearing that comes only to men rendered\n",
        "desperate by adversity. They were clad in mail shirts and worn leather; swords hung at their girdles.\n",
        "\"I knew that Conan spoke the truth when he said it was not Taramis!\" the speaker exclaimed. \"For months\n",
        "I have haunted the outskirts of the palace, playing the part of a deaf beggar. At last I learned what I had\n",
        "believed--that our queen was a prisoner in the dungeons that adjoin the palace. I watched my\n",
        "opportunity and captured a Shemitish jailer--knocked him senseless as he left the courtyard late one\n",
        "night--dragged him into a cellar near by and questioned him. Before he died he told me what I have just\n",
        "told you, and what we have suspected all along--that the woman ruling Khauran is a witch: Salome.\n",
        "Taramis, he said, is imprisoned in the lowest dungeon.\n",
        "\"This invasion of the Zuagirs gives us the opportunity we sought. What Conan means to do, I can not say.\n",
        "Perhaps he merely wishes vengeance on Constantius. Perhaps he intends sacking the city and destroying\n",
        "it. He is a barbarian and no one can understand their minds.\n",
        "\"But this is what we must do: rescue Taramis while the battle rages! Constantius will march out into the\n",
        "plain to give battle. Even now his men are mounting. He will do this because there is not sufficient food\n",
        "in the city to stand a siege. Conan burst out of the desert so suddenly that there was no time to bring in\n",
        "supplies. And the Cimmerian is equipped for a siege. Scouts have reported that the Zuagirs have siege\n",
        "engines, built, undoubtedly, according to the instructions of Conan, who learned all the arts of war\n",
        "among the Western nations.\n",
        "\"Constantius does not desire a long siege; so he will march with his warriors into the plain, where he\n",
        "expects to scatter Conan's forces at one stroke. He will leave only a few hundred men in the city, and they\n",
        "will be on the walls and in the towers commanding the gates.\n",
        "\"The prison will be left all but unguarded. When we have freed Taramis our next actions will depend\n",
        "upon circumstances. If Conan wins, we must show Taramis to the people and bid them rise--they will!\n",
        "Oh, they will! With their bare hands they are enough to overpower the Shemites left in the city and close\n",
        "the gates against both the mercenaries and the nomads. Neither must get within the walls! Then we will\n",
        "parley with Conan. He was always loyal to Taramis. If he knows the truth, and she appeals to him, I\n",
        "believe he will spare the city. If, which is more probable, Constantius prevails, and Conan is routed, we\n",

        "This was true. The dawnlight glinted on peaked helmets pouring in a steady stream through the broad\n",

        "in the lands of the East. The riders flowed through the gates like a river of steel--sombre figures in black\n",
        "and silver mail, with their curled beards and hooked noses, and their inexorable eyes in which glimmered\n",

        "cynically watching Constantius as he settled his broad sword-belt about his lean hips and drew on his\n",
        "gauntlets. They were alone in the chamber. Outside, the rhythmical clank of harness and shuffle of\n",
        "horses' hoofs welled up through the gold-barred casements.\n",
        "\"Before nightfall,\" quoth Constantius, giving a twirl to his thin mustache, \"you'll have some captives to\n",
        "feed to your temple devil. Does it not grow weary of soft, city-bred flesh? Perhaps it would relish the\n",
        "harder thews of a desert man.\"\n",

        "has fought in the West and knows the art of siege. My scouts had some trouble in approaching his\n",
        "columns, for his outriders have eyes like hawks; but they did get close enough to see the engines he is\n",
        "dragging on ox-cart wheels drawn by camels--catapults, rams, ballistas, mangonels--by Ishtar! he must\n",
        "have had ten thousand men working day and night for a month. Where he got the material for their\n",
        "construction is more than I can understand. Perhaps he has a treaty with the Turanians, and gets supplies\n",
        "from them.\n",
        "\"Anyway, they won't do him any good. I've fought these desert wolves before--an exchange of arrows for\n",
        "awhile, in which the armor of my warriors protects them--then a charge and my squadrons sweep\n",
        "through the loose swarms of the nomads, wheel and sweep back through, scattering them to the four\n",
        "winds. I'll ride back through the south gate before sunset, with hundreds of naked captives staggering at\n",
        "my horse's tail. We'll hold a fete tonight, in the great square. My soldiers delight in flaying their enemies\n",
        "alive--we will have a wholesale skinning, and make these weak-kneed townsfolk watch. As for Conan, it\n",
        "will afford me intense pleasure, if we take him alive, to impale him on the palace steps.\"\n",
        "\"Skin as many as you like,\" answered Salome indifferently. \"I would like a dress made of human hide. But\n",
        "at least a hundred captives you must give to me--for the altar, and for Thaug.\"\n",
        "\"It shall be done,\" answered Constantius, with his gauntleted hand brushing back the thin hair from his\n",
        "high, bald forehead, burned dark by the sun. \"For victory and the fair honor of Taramis!\" he said\n",
        "sardonically, and, taking his vizored helmet under his arm, he lifted a hand in salute, and strode clanking\n",
        "from the chamber. His voice drifted back, harshly lifted in orders to his officers.\n",
        "Salome leaned back on the couch, yawned, stretched herself like a great supple cat, and called: \"Zang!\"\n",
        "A cat-footed priest, with features like yellowed parchment stretched over a skull, entered noiselessly.\n",
        "Salome turned to an ivory pedestal on which stood two crystal globes, and taking from it the smaller, she\n",

        "\"Ride with Constantius,\" she said. \"Give me the news of the battle. Go!\"\n",

        "299\n",
        "The skull-faced man bowed low, and hiding the globe under his dark mantle, hurried from the chamber.\n",
        "Outside in the city there was no sound, except the clank of hoofs and after a while the clang of a closing\n",
        "gate. Salome mounted a wide marble stair that led to the flat, canopied, marble-battlemented roof. She\n",
        "was above all other buildings in the city. The streets were deserted, the great square in front of the palace\n",
        "was empty. In normal times folk shunned the grim temple which rose on the opposite side of that square,\n",
        "but now the town looked like a dead city. Only on the southern wall and the roofs that overlooked it was\n",
        "there any sign of life. There the people massed thickly. They made no demonstration, did not know\n",
        "whether to hope for the victory or defeat of Constantius. Victory meant further misery under his\n",
        "intolerable rule; defeat probably meant the sack of the city and red massacre. No word had come from\n",
        "Conan. They did not know what to expect at his hands. They remembered that he was a barbarian.\n",
        "The squadrons of the mercenaries were moving out into the plain. In the distance, just this side of the\n",
        "river, other dark masses were moving, barely recognizable as men on horses. Objects dotted the farther\n",
        "bank; Conan had not brought his siege engines across the river, apparently fearing an attack in the midst\n",
        "of the crossing. But he had crossed with his full force of horsemen. The sun rose and struck glints of fire\n",
        "from the dark multitudes. The squadrons from the city broke into a gallop; a deep roar reached the ears of\n",
        "the people on the wall.\n",
        "The rolling masses merged, intermingled; at that distance it was a tangled confusion in which no details\n",
        "stood out. Charge and countercharge were not to be identified. Clouds of dust rose from the plains, under\n",
        "the stamping hoofs, veiling the action. Through these swirling clouds masses of riders loomed, appearing\n",
        "and disappearing, and spears flashed.\n",
        "Salome shrugged her shoulders and descended the stair. The palace lay silent. All the slaves were on the\n",
        "wall, gazing vainly southward with the citizens.\n",
        "She entered the chamber where she had talked with Constantius, and approached the pedestal, noting\n",
        "that the crystal globe was clouded, shot with bloody streaks of crimson. She bent over the ball, swearing\n",
        "under her breath.\n",
        "\"Zang!\" she called. \"Zang!\"\n",
        "Mists swirled in the sphere, resolving themselves into billowing dust-clouds through which black figures\n",
        "rushed unrecognizably; steel glinted like lightning in the murk. Then the face of Zang leaped into\n",
        "startling distinctness; it was as if the wide eyes gazed up at Salome. Blood trickled from a gash in the\n",
        "skull-like head, the skin was gray with sweat-runneled dust. The lips parted, writhing; to other ears than\n",
        "Salome's it would have seemed that the face in the crystal contorted silently. But sound to her came as\n",

        "He fell back from the door, and then the whir of a shaft past his ear warned him that death was also\n",
        "behind him. He wheeled desperately. Four or five Shemites had cut their way through the throng and\n",
        "were spurring their horses up the steps, their bows lifted to shoot him down. He sprang behind a pillar,\n",
        "on which the arrows splintered. Taramis had fainted. She hung like a dead woman in his arms.\n",
        "Before the Shemites could loose again, the doorway was blocked by a gigantic shape. With affrighted\n",

        "There came a sudden thunder of hoofs; a rout of Shemites, bloody and battered, streamed across the\n",

        "drew and loosed. A cloud of arrows sang across the square, over the seething heads of the multitudes,\n",
        "and sank feather-deep in the black monster. It halted, wavered, reared, a black blot against the marble\n",

        "dead as the witch who had summoned it out of the night of ages.\n",

        "Conan laughed, but shook his head. Rising, he set the queen upon her feet, and beckoned to a number of\n",

        "like a fly on a wall. His groping hands and feet found niches and knobs, precarious holds at best, and\n",
        "sometimes he virtually hung by his finger nails. Yet upward he went, clawing, squirming, fighting for\n",
        "every foot. At times he paused to rest his aching muscles, and, shaking the sweat out of his eyes, twisted\n",
        "his head to stare searchingly out over the jungle, combing the green expanse for any trace of human life\n",
        "or motion.\n",
        "Now the summit was not far above him, and he observed, only a few feet above his head, a break in the\n",
        "sheer stone of the cliff. An instant later he had reached it--a small cavern, just below the edge of the rim.\n",
        "As his head rose above the lip of its floor, he grunted. He clung there, his elbows hooked over the lip. The\n",
        "cave was so tiny that it was little more than a niche cut in the stone, but it held an occupant. A shriveled\n",
        "brown mummy, cross-legged, arms folded on the withered breast upon which the shrunken head was\n",
        "sunk, sat in the little cavern. The limbs were bound in place with rawhide thongs which had become\n",
        "mere rotted wisps. If the form had ever been clothed, the ravages of time had long ago reduced the\n",
        "garments to dust. But thrust between the crossed arms and the shrunken breast there was a roll of\n",

        "The climber stretched forth a long arm and wrenched away this cylinder. Without investigation, he thrust\n",
        "it into his girdle and hauled himself up until he was standing in the opening of the niche. A spring\n",
        "upward and he caught the rim of the cliffs and pulled himself up and over almost with the same motion.\n",
        "There he halted, panting, and stared downward.\n",
        "It was like looking into the interior of a vast bowl, rimmed by a circular stone wall. The floor of the bowl\n",
        "was covered with trees and denser vegetation, though nowhere did the growth duplicate the jungle\n",
        "denseness of the outer forest. The cliffs marched around it without a break and of uniform height. It was\n",
        "a freak of nature, not to be paralleled, perhaps, in the whole world: a vast natural amphitheater, a circular\n",
        "bit of forested plain, three or four miles in diameter, cut off from the rest of the world, and confined\n",
        "within the ring of those palisaded cliffs.\n",
        "But the man on the cliffs did not devote his thoughts to marveling at the topographical phenomenon.\n",
        "With tense eagerness he searched the tree-tops below him, and exhaled a gusty sigh when he caught the\n",
        "glint of marble domes amidst the twinkling green. It was no myth, then; below him lay the fabulous and\n",
        "deserted palace of Alkmeenon.\n",
        "Conan the Cimmerian, late of the Baracha Isles, of the Black Coast, and of many other climes where life\n",

        "hoard of the Turanian kings.\n",
        "Keshan was a barbaric kingdom lying in the eastern hinterlands of Kush where the broad grasslands\n",
        "merge with the forests that roll up from the south. The people were a mixed race, a dusky nobility ruling\n",
        "a population that was largely pure Negro. The rulers--princes and high priests--claimed descent from a\n",
        "white race which, in a mythical age, had ruled a kingdom whose capital city was Alkmeenon. Conflicting\n",
        "legends sought to explain the reason for that race's eventual downfall, and the abandonment of the city\n",
        "by the survivors. Equally nebulous were the tales of the Teeth of Gwahlur, the treasure of Alkmeenon.\n",
        "But these misty legends had been enough to bring Conan to Keshan, over vast distances of plain, riverlaced jungle, and mountains.\n",
        "He had found Keshan, which in itself was considered mythical by many northern and western nations,\n",
        "and he had heard enough to confirm the rumors of the treasure that men called the Teeth of Gwahlur. But\n",

        "employment (he said) he had come to Keshan. For a price he would train the armies of Keshan and lead\n",

        "the king of Keshan, and it also concerned the conquest of Punt--which kingdom, incidentally, lying east\n",
        "of Keshan, had recently expelled the Zembabwan traders and burned their fortresses.\n",
        "His offer outweighed even the prestige of Conan. He pledged himself to invade Punt from the east with a\n",

        "put to no base usage, Thutmekri hastened to explain to the suspicious chieftains; they would be placed in\n",
        "the temple of Zembabwei beside the squat gold idols of Dagon and Derketo, sacred guests in the holy\n",

        "miraculously remained unblemished throughout the ages. Of old, priests had made their way into the\n",

        "Riding as hard as he dared for a night and a day and a night, he came in the early dawn to the cliffs of\n",
        "Alkmeenon, which stood in the southwestern corner of the kingdom, amidst uninhabited jungle which\n",
        "was taboo to the common men. None but the priests dared approach the haunted vale within a distance\n",
        "of many miles. And not even a priest had entered Alkmeenon for a hundred years.\n",
        "No man had ever climbed these cliffs, legends said, and none but the priests knew the secret entrance into\n",
        "the valley. Conan did not waste time looking for it. Steeps that balked these black people, horsemen and\n",
        "dwellers of plain and level forest, were not impossible for a man born in the rugged hills of Cimmeria.\n",
        "Now on the summit of the cliffs he looked down into the circular valley and wondered what plague, war,\n",
        "or superstition had driven the members of that ancient white race forth from their stronghold to mingle\n",
        "with and be absorbed by the black tribes that hemmed them in.\n",
        "This valley had been their citadel. There the palace stood, and there only the royal family and their court\n",
        "dwelt. The real city stood outside the cliffs. Those waving masses of green jungle vegetation hid its ruins.\n",
        "But the domes that glistened in the leaves below him were the unbroken pinnacles of the royal palace of\n",
        "Alkmeenon which had defied the corroding ages.\n",
        "Swinging a leg over the rim he went down swiftly. The inner side of the cliffs was more broken, not quite\n",
        "so sheer. In less than half the time it had taken him to ascend the outer side, he dropped to the swarded\n",
        "valley floor.\n",
        "With one hand on his sword, he looked alertly about him. There was no reason to suppose men lied when\n",
        "they said that Alkmeenon was empty and deserted, haunted only by the ghosts of the dead past. But it\n",
        "was Conan's nature to be suspicious and wary. The silence was primordial; not even a leaf quivered on a\n",
        "branch. When he bent to peer under the trees, he saw nothing but the marching rows of trunks, receding\n",
        "and receding into the blue gloom of the deep woods.\n",
        "Nevertheless he went warily, sword in hand, his restless eyes combing the shadows from side to side, his\n",

        "marble fountains, voiceless and crumbling, stood in circles of slender trees whose patterns were too\n",
        "symmetrical to have been a chance of nature. Forest growth and underbrush had invaded the evenly\n",
        "planned groves, but their outlines were still visible. Broad pavements ran away under the trees, broken,\n",
        "and with grass growing through the wide cracks. He glimpsed walls with ornamental copings, lattices of\n",
        "carven stone that might once have served as the walls of pleasure pavilions.\n",
        "Ahead of him, through the trees, the domes gleamed and the bulk of the structure supporting them\n",
        "became more apparent as he advanced. Presently, pushing through a screen of vine-tangled branches, he\n",
        "came into a comparatively open space where the trees straggled, unencumbered by undergrowth, and\n",
        "saw before him the wide, pillared portico of the palace.\n",
        "As he mounted the broad marble steps, he noted that the building was in far better state of preservation\n",
        "than the lesser structures he had glimpsed. The thick walls and massive pillars seemed too powerful to\n",
        "crumble before the assault of time and the elements. The same enchanted quiet brooded over all. The catlike pad of his sandaled feet seemed startlingly loud in the stillness.\n",
        "Jewels of Gwahlur\n",
        "311\n",
        "Somewhere in this palace lay the effigy or image which had in times past served as oracle for the priests\n",
        "of Keshan. And somewhere in the palace, unless that indiscreet priest had babbled a lie, was hidden the\n",
        "treasure of the forgotten kings of Alkmeenon.\n",
        "Conan passed into a broad, lofty hall, lined with tall columns, between which arches gaped, their doors\n",
        "long rotted away. He traversed this in a twilight dimness, and at the other end passed through great\n",
        "double-valved bronze doors which stood partly open, as they might have stood for centuries. He\n",
        "emerged into a vast domed chamber which must have served as audience hall for the kings of\n",
        "Alkmeenon.\n",
        "It was octagonal in shape, and the great dome up in which the lofty ceiling curved obviously was\n",
        "cunningly pierced, for the chamber was much better lighted than the hall which led to it. At the farther\n",
        "side of the great room there rose a dais with broad lapis-lazuli steps leading up to it, and on that dais\n",
        "there stood a massive chair with ornate arms and a high back which once doubtless supported a cloth-ofgold canopy. Conan grunted explosively and his eyes lit. The golden throne of Alkmeenon, named in\n",
        "immemorial legendry! He weighed it with a practised eye. It represented a fortune in itself, if he were but\n",
        "able to bear it away. Its richness fired his imagination concerning the treasure itself, and made him burn\n",
        "with eagerness. His fingers itched to plunge among the gems he had heard described by story-tellers in\n",
        "the market squares of Keshia, who repeated tales handed down from mouth to mouth through the\n",
        "centuries--jewels not to be duplicated in the world, rubies, emeralds, diamonds, bloodstones, opals,\n",
        "sapphires, the loot of the ancient world.\n",
        "He had expected to find the oracle-effigy seated on the throne, but since it was not, it was probably\n",
        "placed in some other part of the palace, if, indeed, such a thing really existed. But since he had turned his\n",
        "face toward Keshan, so many myths had proved to be realities that he did not doubt that the would find\n",
        "some kind of image or god.\n",
        "Behind the throne there was a narrow arched doorway which doubtless had been masked by hangings in\n",
        "the days of Alkmeenon's life. He glanced through it and saw that it let into an alcove, empty, and with a\n",
        "narrow corridor leading off from it at right angles. Turning away from it, he spied another arch to the left\n",
        "of the dais, and it, unlike the others, was furnished with a door. Nor was it any common door. The portal\n",
        "was of the same rich metal as the throne, and carved with many curious arabesques.\n",
        "At his touch it swung open so readily that its hinges might recently have been oiled. Inside he halted,\n",
        "staring.\n",
        "He was in a square chamber of no great dimensions, whose marble walls rose to an ornate ceiling, inlaid\n",
        "with gold. Gold friezes ran about the base and the top of the walls, and there was no door other than the\n",
        "one through which he had entered. But he noted these details mechanically. His whole attention was\n",
        "centered on the shape which lay on an ivory dais before him.\n",
        "He had expected an image, probably carved with the skill of a forgotten art. But no art could mimic the\n",
        "perfection of the figure that lay before him.\n",
        "It was no effigy of stone or metal or ivory. It was the actual body of a woman, and by what dark art the\n",
        "ancients had preserved that form unblemished for so many ages Conan could not even guess. The very\n",
        "garments she wore were intact--and Conan scowled at that, a vague uneasiness stirring at the back of his \n",
        "Jewels of Gwahlur\n",
        "312\n",
        "mind. The arts that preserved the body should not have affected the garments. Yet there they were--gold\n",
        "breast-plates set with concentric circles of small gems, gilded sandals, and a short silken skirt upheld by a\n",
        "jeweled girdle. Neither cloth nor metal showed any signs of decay.\n",
        "Yelaya was coldly beautiful, even in death. Her body was like alabaster, slender yet voluptuous; a great\n",
        "crimson jewel gleamed against the darkly piled foam of her hair.\n",
        "Conan stood frowning down at her, and then tapped the dais with his sword. Possibilities of a hollow\n",
        "containing the treasure occurred to him, but the dais rang solid. He turned and paced the chamber in\n",
        "some indecision. Where should he search first, in the limited time at his disposal? The priest he had\n",
        "overheard babbling to a courtesan had said the treasure was hidden in the palace. But that included a\n",
        "space of considerable vastness. He wondered if he should hide himself until the priests had come and\n",
        "gone, and then renew the search. But there was a strong chance that they might take the jewels with them\n",
        "when they returned to Keshia. For he was convinced that Thutmekri had corrupted Gorulga.\n",
        "Conan could predict Thutmekri's plans, from his knowledge of the man. He knew that it had been\n",
        "Thutmekri who had proposed the conquest of Punt to the kings of Zembabwei, which conquest was but\n",
        "one move toward their real goal--the capture of the Teeth of Gwahlur. Those wary kings would demand\n",
        "proof that the treasure really existed before they made any move. The jewels Thutmekri asked as a pledge\n",
        "would furnish that proof.\n",
        "With positive evidence of the treasure's reality, the kings of Zimbabwei would move. Punt would be\n",
        "invaded simultaneously from the east and the west, but the Zembabwans would see to it that the Keshani\n",
        "did most of the fighting, and then, when both Punt and Keshan were exhausted from the struggle, the\n",
        "Zembabwans would crush both races, loot Keshan and take the treasure by force, if they had to destroy\n",
        "every building and torture every living human in the kingdom.\n",
        "But there was always another possibility: if Thutmekri could get his hands on the hoard, it would be\n",
        "characteristic of the man to cheat his employers, steal the jewels for himself and decamp, leaving the\n",
        "Zembabwan emissaries holding the sack.\n",
        "Conan believed that this consulting of the oracle was but a ruse to persuade the king of Keshan to accede\n",
        "to Thutmekri's wishes--for he never for a moment doubted that Gorulga was as subtle and devious as all\n",
        "the rest mixed up in this grand swindle. Conan had not approached the high priest himself, because in\n",
        "the game of bribery he would have no chance against Thutmekri, and to attempt it would be to play\n",
        "directly into the Stygian's hands. Gorulga could denounce the Cimmerian to the people, establish a\n",
        "reputation for integrity, and rid Thutmekri of his rival at one stroke. He wondered how Thutmekri had\n",
        "corrupted the high priest, and just what could be offered as a bribe to a man who had the greatest\n",
        "treasure in the world under his fingers.\n",
        "At any rate he was sure that the oracle would be made to say that the gods willed it that Keshan would\n",
        "follow Thutmekri's wishes, and he was sure, too, that it would drop a few pointed remarks concerning\n",
        "himself. After that Keshia would be too hot for the Cimmerian, nor had Conan had any intention of\n",
        "returning when he rode way in the night.\n",
        "The oracle chamber held no clue for him. He went forth into the great throne room and laid his hands on\n",
        "the throne. It was heavy, but he could tilt it up. The floor beneath, a thick marble dais, was solid. Again \n",
        "Jewels of Gwahlur\n",
        "313\n",
        "he sought the alcove. His mind clung to a secret crypt near the oracle. Painstakingly he began to tap along\n",
        "the walls, and presently his taps rang hollow at a spot opposite the mouth of the narrow corridor.\n",
        "Looking more closely he saw that the crack between the marble panel at that point and the next was\n",
        "wider than usual. He inserted a dagger point and pried.\n",
        "Silently the panel swung open, revealing a niche in the wall, but nothing else. He swore feelingly. The\n",
        "aperture was empty, and it did not look as if it had ever served as a crypt for treasure. Leaning into the\n",
        "niche he saw a system of tiny holes in the wall, about on a level with a man's mouth. He peered through,\n",
        "and grunted understandingly. That was the wall that formed the partition between the alcove and the\n",
        "oracle chamber. Those holes had not been visible in the chamber. Conan grinned. This explained the\n",
        "mystery of the oracle, but it was a bit cruder than he had expected. Gorulga would plant either himself or\n",
        "some trusted minion in that niche, to talk through the holes, the credulous acolytes, black men all, would\n",
        "accept it as the veritable voice of Yelaya.\n",
        "Remembering something, the Cimmerian drew forth the roll of parchment he had taken from the\n",
        "mummy and unrolled it carefully, as it seemed ready to fall to pieces with age. He scowled over the dim\n",
        "characters with which it was covered. In his roaming about the world the giant adventurer had picked up\n",
        "a wide smattering of knowledge, particularly including the speaking and reading of many alien tongues.\n",
        "Many a sheltered scholar would have been astonished at the Cimmerian's linguistic abilities, for he had\n",
        "experienced many adventures where knowledge of a strange language had meant the difference between\n",
        "life and death.\n",
        "The characters were puzzling, at once familiar and unintelligible, and presently he discovered the reason.\n",
        "They were the characters of archaic Pelishtic, which possessed many points of difference from the\n",
        "modern script, with which he was familiar, and which, three centuries ago, had been modified by\n",
        "conquest by a nomad tribe. This older, purer script baffled him. He made out a recurrent phrase, however,\n",
        "which he recognized as a proper name: Bit-Yakin. He gathered that it was the name of the writer.\n",
        "Scowling, his lips unconsciously moving as he struggled with the task, he blundered through the\n",
        "manuscript, finding much of it untranslatable and most of the rest of it obscure.\n",
        "He gathered that the writer, the mysterious Bit-Yakin, had come from afar with his servants, and entered\n",
        "the valley of Alkmeenon. Much that followed was meaningless, interspersed as it was with unfamiliar\n",
        "phrases and characters. Such as he could translate seemed to indicate the passing of a very long period of\n",
        "time. The name of Yelaya was repeated frequently, and toward the last part of the manuscript it became\n",
        "apparent that Bit-Yakin knew that death was upon him. With a slight start Conan realized that the\n",

        "no more sound than the pads of a panther would have made; his eyes were slits, his lips unconsciously\n",
        "asnarl. Panic had momentarily touched his soul at the shock of that unexpected reverberation, and the\n",

        "caught his eye. It was the gong, a great gold disk, hanging from a gold arm extending from the crumbling\n",

        "gaped emptily. Conan crouched inside the doorway for what seemed a long time. There was no sound or\n",
        "movement throughout the great palace. His patience exhausted at last, he glided around the curve of the\n",

        "cobra strikes.\n",
        "He reached the gong, started into the arch nearest it. He saw only a dim chamber, littered with the debris\n",
        "of decay. Beneath the gong the polished marble flags showed no footprint, but there was a scent in the\n",
        "air--a faintly fetid odor he could not classify; his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast as he sought in\n",
        "vain to identify it.\n",

        "lanced the darkness ahead of him. He saw the surging, seething black surface of the water, in turmoil as if \n",
        "Jewels of Gwahlur\n",
        "315\n",
        "disturbed by some monster of the deep, and he saw the sheer stone walls of the channel curved up to a\n",
        "vault overhead. On each side ran a narrow ledge, just below the arching roof, but they were far out of his\n",
        "reach. At one point this roof had been broken, probably fallen in, and the light was streaming through the\n",
        "aperture. Beyond that shaft of light was utter blackness, and panic assailed the Cimmerian as he saw he\n",
        "would be swept on past that spot of light, and into the unknown blackness again.\n",
        "Then he saw something else: bronze ladders extending from the ledges to the water's surface at regular\n",
        "intervals, and there was one just ahead of him. Instantly he struck out for it, fighting the current that\n",
        "would have held him to the middle of the stream. It dragged at him as with tangible, animate, slimy\n",
        "hands, but he buffeted the rushing surge with the strength of desperation and drew closer and closer\n",
        "inshore, fighting furiously for every inch. Now he was even with the ladder and with a fierce, gasping\n",
        "plunge he gripped the bottom rung and hung on, breathless.\n",
        "A few seconds later he struggled up out of the seething water, trusting his weight dubiously to the\n",
        "corroded rungs. They sagged and bent, but they held, and he clambered up onto the narrow ledge which\n",
        "ran along the wall scarcely a man's length below the curving roof. The tall Cimmerian was forced to bend\n",
        "his head as he stood up. A heavy bronze door showed in the stone at a point even with the head of the\n",
        "ladder, but it did not give to Conan's efforts. He transferred his sword from his teeth to its scabbard,\n",
        "spitting blood--for the edge had cut his lips in that fierce fight with the river--and turned his attention to\n",
        "the broken roof.\n",
        "He could reach his arms up through the crevice and grip the edge, and careful testing told him it would\n",
        "bear his weight. An instant later he had drawn himself up through the hole, and found himself in a wide\n",
        "chamber, in a state of extreme disrepair. Most of the roof had fallen in, as well as a great section of the\n",
        "floor, which was laid over the vault of a subterranean river. Broken arches opened into other chambers\n",
        "and corridors, and Conan believed he was still in the great palace. He wondered uneasily how many\n",
        "chambers in that palace had underground water directly under them, and when the ancient flags or tiles\n",
        "might give way again and precipitate him back into the current from which he had just crawled.\n",
        "And he wondered just how much of an accident that fall had been. Had those rotten flags simply chanced\n",
        "to give way beneath his weight, or was there a more sinister explanation? One thing at least was obvious:\n",
        "he was not the only living thing in that palace. That gong had not sounded of its own accord, whether the\n",
        "noise had been meant to lure him to his death, or not. The silence of the palace became suddenly sinister,\n",
        "fraught with crawling menace.\n",
        "Could it be someone on the same mission as himself? A sudden thought occurred to him, at the memory\n",
        "of the mysterious Bit-Yakin. Was it not possible that this man had found the Teeth of Gwahlur in his long\n",
        "residence in Alkmeenon--that his servants had taken them with them when they departed? The\n",
        "possibility that he might be following a will-o'-the-wisp infuriated the Cimmerian.\n",
        "Choosing a corridor which he believed led back toward the part of the palace he had first entered, he\n",

        "and halls he traversed were crumbling into ruin, but as he advanced the ravages of decay became less\n",
        "apparent. He wondered briefly for what purpose the ladders had been suspended from the ledges over\n",
        "the subterranean river, but dismissed the matter with a shrug. He was little interested in speculating over\n",
        "unremunerative problems of antiquity.\n",
        "He was not sure just where the oracle chamber lay, from where he was, but presently he emerged into a\n",

        "\"You--are--are you Yelaya?\" he stammered.\n",
        "\"I am Yelaya!\" The voice was rich and musical, and he stared with new wonder. \"Do not fear. I will not\n",
        "harm you if you do my bidding.\"\n",
        "\"How can a dead woman come to life after all these centuries?\" he demanded, as if skeptical of what his\n",

        "closer, as if impelled by a powerful fascination--without the slightest warning he grabbed her up in a\n",
        "bear-like grasp. She screamed a very ungoddess-like scream, and there was a sound of ripping silk, as\n",
        "with one ruthless wrench he tore off her skirt.\n",

        "thought it was strange that a princess of Alkmeenon would speak with a Corinthian accent! As soon as\n",
        "I'd gathered my wits I knew I'd seen you somewhere. You're Muriela, Zargheba's Corinthian dancing girl.\n",
        "This crescent-shaped birthmark on your hip proves it. I saw it once when Zargheba was whipping you.\n",

        "lifted up her voice and wept unashamedly. Her captor glared down at her with angry triumph.\n",
        "\"Goddess! Ha! So you were one of the veiled women Zargheba brought to Keshia with him. Did you\n",
        "think you could fool me, you little idiot? A year ago I saw you in Akbitana with that swine, Zargheba,\n",
        "and I don't forget faces--or women's figures. I think I'll--\"\n",
        "Squirming about in his grasp she threw her slender arms about his massive neck in an abandon of terror;\n",

        "\"Why, you sacrilegious little hussy!\" rumbled Conan. \"Do you not fear the gods? Crom! Is there no\n",
        "honesty anywhere?\"\n",
        "\"Oh, please!\" she begged, quivering with abject fright. \"I couldn't disobey Zargheba. Oh, what shall I do? I\n",

        "knees and mingling incoherent pleas for mercy and protection with piteous protestations of her\n",
        "innocence of any malign intention. It was a vivid change from her pose as the ancient princess, but not\n",
        "surprising. The fear that had nerved her then was now her undoing.\n",

        "\"Outside the palace,\" she whimpered, \"watching for the priests.\"\n",
        "\"How many men with him?\"\n",
        "\"None. We came alone.\"\n",
        "Jewels of Gwahlur\n",

        "\"Ha!\" It was much like the satisfied grunt of a hunting lion. \"You must have left Keshia a few hours after I\n",
        "did. Did you climb the cliffs?\"\n",
        "She shook her head, too choked with tears to speak coherently. With an impatient imprecation he seized\n",

        "\"Zargheba knew the secret way,\" she gasped. \"The priest Gwarunga told him, and Thutmekri. On the\n",
        "south side of the valley there is a broad pool lying at the foot of the cliffs. There is a cave-mouth under the\n",
        "surface of the water that is not visible to the casual glance. We ducked under the water and entered it.\n",

        "\"We came to the palace and Zargheba hid me among the trees while he went to look for the chamber of\n",
        "the oracle. I do not think he fully trusted Gwarunga. While he was gone I thought I heard a gong sound,\n",
        "but I was not sure. Presently Zargheba came and took me into the palace and brought me to this chamber,\n",
        "where the goddess Yelaya lay upon the dais. He stripped the body and clothed me in the garments and\n",
        "ornaments. Then he went forth to hide the body and watch for the priests. I have been afraid. When you\n",
        "entered I wanted to leap up and beg you to take me away from this place, but I feared Zargheba. When\n",
        "you discovered I was alive, I thought I could frighten you away.\"\n",

        "\"I was to bid the priests to take the Teeth of Gwahlur and give some of them to Thutmekri as a pledge, as\n",
        "he desired, and place the rest in the palace at Keshia. I was to tell them that an awful doom threatened\n",
        "Keshan if they did not agree to Thutmekri's proposals. And, oh, yes, I was to tell them that you were to be\n",
        "skinned alive immediately.\"\n",
        "\"Thutmekri wanted the treasure where he--or the Zembabwans--could lay hand on it easily,\" muttered\n",

        "\"No. He believes in his gods, and is incorruptible. He knows nothing about this. He will obey the oracle.\n",
        "It was all Thutmekri's plan. Knowing the Keshani would consult the oracle, he had Zargheba bring me\n",
        "with the embassy from Zembabwei, closely veiled and secluded.\"\n",
        "\"Well, I'm damned!\" muttered Conan. \"A priest who honestly believes in his oracle, and can not be bribed.\n",

        "stripped the garment from the dancer's writhing body. But the skirt showed no rent. A single stride\n",

        "door, and none could have entered or departed through that without his knowledge. This much was\n",
        "indisputable: Yelaya had been replaced on the dais within the few minutes that had elapsed since Muriela\n",
        "had first left the chamber to be seized by Gwarunga; his ears were still tingling with the echoes of\n",
        "Muriela's scream, yet the Corinthian girl had vanished as if into thin air. There was but one explanation,\n",
        "if he rejected the darker speculation that suggested the supernatural--somewhere in the chamber there\n",
        "was a secret door. And even as the thought crossed his mind, he saw it.\n",
        "In what had seemed a curtain of solid marble, a thin perpendicular crack showed and in the crack hung a\n",
        "wisp of silk. In an instant he was bending over it. That shred was from Muriela's torn skirt. The\n",
        "implication was unmistakable. It had been caught in the closing door and torn off as she was borne\n",
        "through the opening by whatever grim beings were her captors. The bit of clothing had prevented the\n",

        "Thrusting his dagger-point into the crack, Conan exerted leverage with a corded forearm. The blade bent,\n",
        "but it was of unbreakable Akbitanan steel. The marble door opened. Conan's sword was lifted as he\n",

        "saw nothing, heard nothing. A dozen steps down, the stair ended in a narrow corridor which ran straight\n",
        "away into gloom.\n",
        "He halted suddenly, posed like a statue at the foot of the stair, staring at the paintings which frescoed the\n",
        "walls, half visible in the dim light which filtered down from above. The art was unmistakably Pelishti; he\n",
        "had seen frescoes of identical characteristics on the walls of Asgalun. But the scenes depicted had no\n",
        "connection with anything Pelishti, except for one human figure, frequently recurrent: a lean, whitebearded old man whose racial characteristics were unmistakable. They seemed to represent various\n",
        "sections of the palace above. Several scenes showed a chamber he recognized as the oracle chamber with\n",
        "the figure of Yelaya stretched upon the ivory dais and huge black men kneeling before it. And there\n",
        "behind the wall, in the niche, lurked the ancient Pelishti. And there were other figures, too--figures that\n",
        "moved through the deserted palace, did the bidding of the Pelishti, and dragged unnamable things out of\n",
        "the subterranean river. In the few seconds Conan stood frozen, hitherto unintelligible phrases in the\n",
        "parchment manuscript blazed in his brain with chilling clarity. The loose bits of the pattern clicked into\n",
        "place. The mystery of Bit-Yakin was a mystery no longer, nor the riddle of Bit-Yakin's servants.\n",
        "Conan turned and peered into the darkness, an icy finger crawling along his spine. Then he went along\n",

        "farther away from the stair. The air hung heavy with the odor he had scented in the court of the gong.\n",
        "Now in utter blackness he heard a sound ahead of him--the shuffle of bare feet, or the swish of loose\n",
        "garments against stone, he could not tell which. But an instant later his outstretched hand encountered a\n",
        "barrier which he identified as a massive door of carved metal. He pushed against it fruitlessly, and his\n",
        "sword-point sought vainly for a crack. It fitted into the sill and jambs as if molded there. He exerted all\n",
        "his strength, his feet straining against the floor, the veins knotting in his temples. It was useless; a charge\n",
        "of elephants would scarcely have shaken that titanic portal.\n",
        "As he leaned there he caught a sound on the other side that his ears instantly identified--it was the creak\n",
        "of rusty iron, like a lever scraping in its slot. Instinctively action followed recognition so spontaneously\n",
        "that sound, impulse and action were practically simultaneous. And as his prodigious bound carried him\n",
        "backward, there was the rush of a great bulk from above, and a thunderous crash filled the tunnel with\n",
        "deafening vibrations. Bits of flying splinters struck him--a huge block of stone, he knew from the sound,\n",
        "dropped on the spot he had just quitted. An instant's slower thought or action and it would have crushed\n",
        "him like an ant.\n",
        "Conan fell back. Somewhere on the other side of that metal door Muriela was a captive, if she still lived.\n",
        "But he could not pass that door, and if he remained in the tunnel another block might fall, and he might\n",
        "not be so lucky. It would do the girl no good for him to be crushed into a purple pulp. He could not\n",
        "continue his search in that direction. He must get above ground and look for some other avenue of\n",
        "approach.\n",
        "He turned and hurried toward the stair, sighing as he emerged into comparative radiance. And as he set\n",

        "spread their shimmering petals, through verdant, tangled bushes that showered blooms at the touch,\n",
        "until he came at last to a great mass of rock that jutted like a titan's castle out from the cliffs at a point\n",
        "closest to the palace, which, however, was almost hidden from view by vine-interlaced trees. Evidently\n",
        "that babbling priest in Keshia had been mistaken when he said the Teeth were hidden in the palace. This\n",
        "trail had led him away from the place where Muriela had disappeared, but a belief was growing in\n",
        "Conan that each part of the valley was connected with that palace by subterranean passages.\n",
        "Crouching in the deep, velvet-black shadows of the bushes, he scrutinized the great jut of rock which\n",
        "stood out in bold relief in the moonlight. It was covered with strange, grotesque carvings, depicting men\n",
        "and animals, and half-bestial creatures that might have been gods or devils. The style of art differed so\n",
        "strikingly from that of the rest of the valley, that Conan wondered if it did not represent a different era\n",
        "and race, and was itself a relic of an age lost and forgotten at whatever immeasurably distant date the\n",
        "people of Alkmeenon had found and entered the haunted valley.\n",
        "A great door stood open in the sheer curtain of the cliff, and a gigantic dragon's head was carved about it\n",
        "so that the open door was like the dragon's gaping mouth. The door itself was of carven bronze and\n",
        "looked to weigh several tons. There was no lock that he could see, but a series of bolts showing along the\n",
        "edge of the massive portal, as it stood open, told him that there was some system of locking and\n",
        "unlocking--a system doubtless known only to the priests of Keshan.\n",
        "The trail showed that Gorulga and his henchmen had gone through that door. But Conan hesitated. To\n",
        "wait until they emerged would probably mean to see the door locked in his face, and he might not be able\n",
        "to solve the mystery of its unlocking. On the other hand, if he followed them in, they might emerge and\n",
        "lock him in the cavern.\n",
        "Throwing caution to the winds, he glided through the great portal. Somewhere in the cavern were the\n",
        "priests, the Teeth of Gwahlur, and perhaps a clue to the fate of Muriela. Personal risks had never yet\n",
        "deterred him from any purpose.\n",
        "Moonlight illumined, for a few yards, the wide tunnel in which he found himself. Somewhere ahead of\n",
        "him he saw a faint glow and heard the echo of a weird chanting. The priests were not so far ahead of him\n",
        "as he had thought. The tunnel debouched into a wide room before the moonlight played out, an empty\n",
        "cavern of no great dimensions, but with a lofty, vaulted roof, glowing with a phosphorescent\n",
        "encrustation, which, as Conan knew, was a common phenomenon in that part of the world. It made a\n",
        "ghostly half-light, in which he was able to see a bestial image squatting on a shrine, and the black mouths\n",
        "of six or seven tunnels leading off from the chamber. Down the widest of these--the one directly behind\n",
        "the squat image which looked toward the outer opening--he caught the gleam of torches wavering,\n",
        "whereas the phosphorescent glow was fixed, and heard the chanting increase in volume.\n",
        "Down it he went recklessly, and was presently peering into a larger cavern than the one he had just left.\n",
        "There was no phosphorus here, but the light of the torches fell on a larger altar and a more obscene and\n",
        "repulsive god squatting toad-like upon it. Before this repugnant deity, Gorulga and his ten acolytes knelt\n",
        "and beat their heads upon the ground, while chanting monotonously. Conan realized why their progress\n",
        "had been so slow. Evidently approaching the secret crypt of the Teeth was a complicated and elaborate\n",
        "ritual.\n",
        "Jewels of Gwahlur\n",
        "328\n",
        "He was fidgeting in nervous impatience before the chanting and bowing were over, but presently they\n",
        "rose and passed into the tunnel which opened behind the idol. Their torches bobbed away into the\n",
        "nighted vault, and he followed swiftly. Not much danger of being discovered. He glided along the\n",
        "shadows like a creature of the night, and the black priests were completely engrossed in their ceremonial\n",
        "mummery. Apparently they had not even noticed the absence of Gwarunga.\n",
        "Emerging into a cavern of huge proportions, about whose upward curving walls gallery-like ledges\n",
        "marched in tiers, they began their worship anew before an altar which was larger, and a god which was\n",
        "more disgusting, than any encountered thus far.\n",
        "Conan crouched in the black mouth of the tunnel, staring at the walls reflecting the lurid glow of the\n",
        "torches. He saw a carven stone stair winding up from tier to tier of the galleries; the roof was lost in\n",
        "darkness.\n",
        "He started violently and the chanting broke off as the kneeling blacks flung up their heads. An inhuman\n",
        "voice boomed out high above them. They froze on their knees, their faces turned upward with a ghastly\n",
        "blue hue in the sudden glare of a weird light that burst blindingly up near the lofty roof and then burned\n",
        "with a throbbing glow. That glare lighted a gallery and a cry went up from the high priest, echoed\n",
        "shudderingly by his acolytes. In the flash there had been briefly disclosed to them a slim white figure\n",
        "standing upright in a sheen of silk and a glint of jewel-crusted gold. Then the blaze smoldered to a\n",
        "throbbing, pulsing luminosity in which nothing was distinct, and that slim shape was but a shimmering\n",
        "blur of ivory.\n",
        "\"Yelaya!\" screamed Gorulga, his brown features ashen. \"Why have you followed us? What is your\n",
        "pleasure?\"\n",
        "That weird unhuman voice rolled down from the roof, re-echoing under that arching vault that\n",
        "magnified and altered it beyond recognition.\n",
        "\"Woe to the unbelievers! Woe to the false children of Keshia! Doom to them which deny their deity!\"\n",
        "A cry of horror went up from the priests. Gorulga looked like a shocked vulture in the glare of the torches.\n",
        "\"I do not understand!\" he stammered. \"We are faithful. In the chamber of the oracle you told us--\"\n",
        "\"Do not heed what you heard in the chamber of the oracle!\" rolled that terrible voice, multiplied until it\n",
        "was as though a myriad voices thundered and muttered the same warning. \"Beware of false prophets and\n",
        "false gods! A demon in my guise spoke to you in the palace, giving false prophecy. Now harken and obey,\n",
        "for only I am the true goddess, and I give you one chance to save yourselves from doom!\n",
        "\"Take the Teeth of Gwahlur from the crypt where they were placed so long ago. Alkmeenon is no longer\n",
        "holy, because it has been desecrated by blasphemers. Give the Teeth of Gwahlur into the hands of\n",
        "Thutmekri, the Stygian, to place in the sanctuary of Dagon and Derketo. Only this can save Keshan from\n",
        "the doom the demons of the night have plotted. Take the Teeth of Gwahlur and go; return instantly to\n",

        "329\n",
        "There was no hesitation in obeying. Chattering with fear the priests scrambled up and ran for the door\n",
        "that opened behind the bestial god. Gorulga led the flight. They jammed briefly in the doorway, yelping\n",
        "as wildly waving torches touched squirming black bodies; they plunged through, and the patter of their\n",
        "speeding feet dwindled down the tunnel.\n",
        "Conan did not follow. He was consumed with a furious desire to learn the truth of this fantastic affair.\n",
        "Was that indeed Yelaya, as the cold sweat on the backs of his hands told him, or was it that little hussy\n",
        "Muriela, turned traitress after all? If it was--\n",
        "Before the last torch had vanished down the black tunnel he was bounding vengefully up the stone stair.\n",
        "The blue glow was dying down, but he could still make out that the ivory figure stood motionless on the\n",
        "gallery. His blood ran cold as he approached it, but he did not hesitate. He came on with his sword lifted,\n",
        "and towered like a threat of death over the inscrutable shape.\n",
        "\"Yelaya!\" he snarled. \"Dead as she's been for a thousand years! Ha!\"\n",
        "From the dark mouth of a tunnel behind him a dark form lunged. But the sudden, deadly rush of unshod\n",
        "feet had reached the Cimmerian's quick ears. He whirled like a cat and dodged the blow aimed\n",
        "murderously at his back. As the gleaming steel in the dark hand hissed past him, he struck back with the\n",
        "fury of a roused python, and the long straight blade impaled his assailant and stood out a foot and a half\n",
        "between his shoulders.\n",
        "\"So!\" Conan tore his sword free as the victim sagged to the floor, gasping and gurgling. The man writhed\n",
        "briefly and stiffened. In the dying light Conan saw a black body and ebon countenance, hideous in the\n",
        "blue glare. He had killed Gwarunga.\n",
        "Conan turned from the corpse to the goddess. Thongs about her knees and breast held her upright\n",
        "against tha stone pillar, and her thick hair, fastened to the column, held her head up. At a few yards'\n",
        "distance these bonds were not visible in the uncertain light.\n",
        "\"He must have come to after I descended into the tunnel,\" muttered Conan. \"He must have suspected I\n",
        "was down there. So he pulled out the dagger\"--Conan stooped and wrenched the identical weapon from\n",
        "the stiffening fingers, glanced at it and replaced it in his own girdle--\"and shut the door. Then he took\n",
        "Yelaya to befool his brother idiots. That was he shouting a while ago. You couldn't recognize his voice,\n",
        "under this echoing roof. And that bursting blue flame--I thought it looked familiar. It's a trick of the\n",
        "Stygian priests. Thutmekri must have given some of it to Gwarunga.\"\n",
        "The man could easily have reached this cavern ahead of his companions. Evidently familiar with the plan\n",
        "of the caverns by hearsay or by maps handed down in the priestcraft, he had entered the cave after the\n",
        "others, carrying the goddess, followed a circuitous route through the tunnels and chambers, and\n",
        "ensconced himself and his burden on the balcony while Gorulga and the other acolytes were engaged in\n",
        "their endless rituals.\n",
        "The blue glare had faded, but now Conan was aware of another glow, emanating from the mouth of one\n",
        "of the corridors that opened on the ledge. Somewhere down that corridor there was another field of\n",
        "phosphorus, for he recognized the faint steady radiance. The corridor led in the direction the priests had\n",
        "taken, and he decided to follow it, rather than descend into the darkness of the great cavern below.\n",
        "Doubtless it connected with another gallery in some other chamber, which might be the destination of the \n",
        "Jewels of Gwahlur\n",
        "330\n",
        "priests. He hurried down it, the illumination growing stronger as he advanced, until he could make out\n",
        "the floor and the walls of the tunnel. Ahead of him and below he could hear the priests chanting again.\n",
        "Abruptly a doorway in the left-hand wall was limned in the phosphorous glow, and to his ears came the\n",
        "sound of soft, hysterical sobbing. He wheeled, and glared through the door.\n",
        "He was looking again into a chamber hewn out of solid rock, not a natural cavern like the others. The\n",
        "domed roof shone with the phosphorous light, and the walls were almost covered with arabesques of\n",
        "beaten gold.\n",
        "Near the farther wall on a granite throne, staring for ever toward the arched doorway, sat the monstrous\n",
        "and obscene Pteor, the god of the Pelishti, wrought in brass, with his exaggerated attributes reflecting the\n",
        "grossness of his cult. And in his lap sprawled a limp white figure.\n",
        "\"Well, I'll be damned!\" muttered Conan. He glanced suspiciously about the chamber, seeing no other\n",
        "entrance or evidence of occupation, and then advanced noiselessly and looked down at the girl whose\n",
        "slim shoulders shook with sobs of abject misery, her face sunk in her arms. From thick bands of gold on\n",
        "the idol's arms slim gold chains ran to smaller bands on her wrists. He laid a hand on her naked shoulder\n",
        "and she started convulsively, shrieked, and twisted her tear-stained face toward him.\n",
        "\"Conan!\" She made a spasmodic effort to go into the usual clinch, but the chains hindered her. He cut\n",
        "through the soft gold as close to her wrists as he could, grunting: \"You'll have to wear these bracelets\n",
        "until I can find a chisel or a file. Let go of me, damn it! You actresses are too damned emotional. What\n",
        "happened to you, anyway?\"\n",
        "\"When I went back into the oracle chamber,\" she whimpered, \"I saw the goddess lying on the dais as I'd\n",
        "first seen her. I called out to you and started to run to the door--then something grabbed me from behind.\n",
        "It clapped a hand over my mouth and carried me through a panel in the wall, and down some steps and\n",
        "along a dark hall. I didn't see what it was that had hold of me until we passed through a big metal door\n",
        "and came into a tunnel whose roof was alight, like this chamber.\n",
        "\"Oh, I nearly fainted when I saw! They are not humans! They are gray, hairy devils that walk like men\n",
        "and speak a gibberish no human could understand. They stood there and seemed to be waiting, and once\n",
        "I thought I heard somebody trying the door. Then one of the things pulled a metal lever in the wall, and\n",
        "something crashed on the other side of the door.\n",
        "\"Then they carried me on and on through winding tunnels and up stone stairways into this chamber,\n",
        "where they chained me on the knees of this abominable idol, and then they went away. Oh, Conan, what\n",
        "are they?\"\n",
        "\"Servants of Bit-Yakin,\" he grunted. \"I found a manuscript that told me a number of things, and then\n",
        "stumbled upon some frescoes that told me the rest. Bit-Yakin was a Pelishti who wandered into the valley\n",
        "with his servants after the people of Alkmeenon had deserted it. He found the body of Princess Yelaya,\n",
        "and discovered that the priests returned from time to time to make offerings to her, for even then she was\n",
        "worshipped as a goddess.\n",
        "\"He made an oracle of her, and he was the voice of the oracle, speaking from a niche he cut in the wall\n",
        "behind the ivory dais. The priests never suspected, never saw him or his servants, for they always hid \n",
        "Jewels of Gwahlur\n",
        "331\n",
        "themselves when the men came. Bit-Yakin lived and died here without ever being discovered by the\n",
        "priests. Crom knows how long he dwelt here, but it must have been for centuries. The wise men of the\n",
        "Pelishti know how to increase the span of their lives for hundreds of years. I've seen some of them myself.\n",
        "Why he lived here alone, and why he played the part of oracle no ordinary human can guess, but I\n",
        "believe the oracle part was to keep the city inviolate and sacred, so he could remain undisturbed. He ate\n",
        "the food the priests brought as an offering to Yelaya, and his servants ate other things--I've always known\n",
        "there was a subterranean river flowing away from the lake where the people of the Puntish highlands\n",
        "throw their dead. That river runs under this palace. They have ladders hung over the water where they\n",
        "can hang and fish for the corpses that come floating through. Bit-Yakin recorded everything on\n",
        "parchment and painted walls.\n",
        "\"But he died at last, and his servants mummified him according to instructions he gave them before his\n",
        "death, and stuck him in a cave in the cliffs. The rest is easy to guess. His servants, who were even more\n",
        "nearly immortal than he, kept on dwelling here, but the next time a high priest came to consult the oracle,\n",
        "not having a master to restrain them, they tore him to pieces. So since then--until Gorulga--nobody came\n",
        "to talk to the oracle.\n",
        "\"It's obvious they've been renewing the garments and ornaments of the goddess, as they'd seen Bit-Yakin\n",
        "do. Doubtless there's a sealed chamber somewhere were the silks are kept from decay. They clothed the\n",
        "goddess and brought her back to the oracle room after Zargheba had stolen her. And, oh, by the way,\n",
        "they took off Zargheba's head and hung it up in a thicket.\"\n",
        "She shivered, yet at the same time breathed a sigh of relief.\n",
        "\"He'll never whip me again.\"\n",
        "\"Not this side of Hell,\" agreed Conan. \"But come on, Gwarunga ruined my chances with his stolen\n",
        "goddess. I'm going to follow the priests and take my chance of stealing the loot from them after they get it.\n",
        "And you stay close to me. I can't spend all my time looking for you.\"\n",
        "\"But the servants of Bit-Yakin!\" she whispered fearfully.\n",
        "\"We'll have to take our chance,\" he grunted. \"I don't know what's in their minds, but so far they haven't\n",
        "shown any disposition to come out and fight in the open. Come on.\"\n",
        "Taking her wrist he led her out of the chamber and down the corridor. As they advanced they heard the\n",
        "chanting of the priests, and mingling with the sound the low sullen rushing of waters. The light grew\n",
        "stronger above them as they emerged on a high-pitched gallery of a great cavern and looked down on a\n",
        "scene weird and fantastic.\n",
        "Above them gleamed the phosphorescent roof; a hundred feet below them stretched the smooth floor of\n",
        "the cavern. On the far side this floor was cut by a deep, narrow stream brimming its rocky channel.\n",
        "Rushing out of impenetrable gloom, it swirled across the cavern and was lost again in darkness. The\n",
        "visible surface reflected the radiance above; the dark seething waters glinted as if flecked with living\n",
        "jewels, frosty blue, lurid red, shimmering green, and ever-changing iridescence.\n",
        "Conan and his companion stood upon one of the gallery-like ledges that banded the curve of the lofty\n",
        "wall, and from this ledge a natural bridge of stone soared in a breath-taking arch over the vast gulf of the \n",
        "Jewels of Gwahlur\n",
        "332\n",
        "cavern to join a much smaller ledge on the opposite side, across the river. Ten feet below it another,\n",
        "broader arch spanned the cave. At either end a carved stair joined the extremities of these flying arches.\n",
        "Conan's gaze, following the curve of the arch that swept away from the ledge on which they stood,\n",
        "caught a glint of light that was not the lurid phosphorus of the cavern. On that small ledge opposite them\n",
        "there was an opening in the cave wall through which stars were glinting.\n",
        "But his full attention was drawn to the scene beneath them. The priests had reached their destination.\n",
        "There in a sweeping angle of the cavern wall stood a stone altar, but there was no idol upon it. Whether\n",
        "there was one behind it, Conan could not ascertain, because some trick of the light, or the sweep of the\n",
        "wall, left the space behind the altar in total darkness.\n",
        "The priests had stuck their torches into holes in the stone floor, forming a semicircle of fire in front of the\n",
        "altar at a distance of several yards. Then the priests themselves formed a semicircle inside the crescent of\n",
        "torches, and Gorulga, after lifting his arms aloft in invocation, bent to the altar and laid hands on it. It\n",
        "lifted and tilted backward on its hinder edge, like the lid of a chest, revealing a small crypt.\n",
        "Extending a long arm into the recess, Gorulga brought up a small brass chest. Lowering the altar back\n",
        "into place, he set the chest on it, and threw back the lid. To the eager watchers on the high gallery, it\n",
        "seemed as if the action had released a blaze of living fire which throbbed and quivered about the opened\n",
        "chest. Conan's heart leaped and his hand caught at his hilt. The Teeth of Gwahlur at last! The treasure\n",
        "that would make its possessor the richest man in the world! His breath came fast between his clenched\n",
        "teeth.\n",
        "Then he was suddenly aware that a new element had entered into the light of the torches and of the\n",
        "phosphorescent roof, rendering both void. Darkness stole around the altar, except for that glowing spot\n",
        "of evil radiance cast by the Teeth of Gwahlur, and that grew and grew. The blacks froze into basaltic\n",
        "statues, their shadows streaming grotesquely and gigantically out behind them.\n",
        "The altar was laved in the glow now, and the astounded features of Gorulga stood out in sharp relief.\n",
        "Then the mysterious space behind the altar swam into the widening illumination. And slowly with the\n",
        "crawling light, figures became visible, like shapes growing out of the night and silence.\n",
        "At first they seemed like gray stone statues, those motionless shapes, hairy, man-like, yet hideously\n",
        "human; but their eyes were alive, cold sparks of gray icy fire. And as the weird glow lit their bestial\n",
        "countenances, Gorulga screamed and fell backward, throwing up his long arms in a gesture of frenzied\n",
        "horror.\n",
        "But a longer arm shot across the altar and a misshapen hand locked on his throat. Screaming and fighting,\n",
        "the high priest was dragged back across the altar; a hammer-like fist smashed down, and Gorulga's cries\n",
        "were stilled. Limp and broken he sagged cross the altar; his brains oozing from his crushed skull. And\n",
        "then the servants of Bit-Yakin surged like a bursting flood from Hell on the black priests who stood like\n",
        "horror-blasted images.\n",
        "Then there was slaughter, grim and appalling.\n",
        "Conan saw black bodies tossed like chaff in the inhuman hands of the slayers, against whose horrible\n",
        "strength and agility the daggers and swords of the priests were ineffective. He saw men lifted bodily and \n",
        "Jewels of Gwahlur\n",
        "333\n",
        "their heads cracked open against the stone altar. He saw a flaming torch, grasped in a monstrous hand,\n",
        "thrust inexorably down the gullet of an agonized wretch who writhed in vain against the arms that\n",
        "pinioned him. He saw a man torn in two pieces, as one might tear a chicken, and the bloody fragments\n",
        "hurled clear across the cavern. The massacre was as short and devastating as the rush of a hurricane. In a\n",
        "burst of red abysmal ferocity it was over, except for one wretch who fled screaming back the way the\n",
        "priests had come, pursued by a swarm of blood-dabbled shapes of horror which reached out their redsmeared hands for him. Fugitive and pursuers vanished down the black tunnel, and the screams of the\n",
        "human came back dwindling and confused by the distance.\n",
        "Muriela was on her knees clutching Conan's legs; her face pressed against his knee and her eyes tightly\n",
        "shut. She was a quaking, quivering mold of abject terror. But Conan was galvanized. A quick glance\n",
        "across at the aperture where the stars shone, a glance down at the chest that still blazed open on the\n",

        "leave me!\"\n",
        "\"Lie still and keep your mouth shut!\" he snapped, disengaging himself from her frantic clasp.\n",
        "He disregarded the tortuous stair. He dropped from ledge to ledge with reckless haste. There was no sign\n",
        "of the monsters as his feet hit the floor. A few of the torches still flared in their sockets, the\n",
        "phosphorescent glow throbbed and quivered, and the river flowed with an almost articulate muttering,\n",
        "scintillant with undreamed radiances. The glow that had heralded the appearance of the servants had\n",
        "vanished with them. Only the light of the jewels in the brass chest shimmered and quivered.\n",
        "He snatched the chest, noting its contents in one lustful glance--strange, curiously shapen stones that\n",
        "burned with an icy, non-terrestrial fire. He slammed the lid, thrust the chest under his arm, and ran back\n",
        "up the steps. He had no desire to encounter the hellish servants of Bit-Yakin. His glimpse of them in\n",
        "action had dispelled any illusion concerning their fighting ability. Why they had waited so long before\n",
        "striking at the invaders he was unable to say. What human could guess the motives or thoughts of these\n",

        "demonstrated. And there on the cavern floor lay crimson proof of their bestial ferocity.\n",
        "The Corinthian girl still cowered on the gallery where he had left her. He caught her wrist and yanked\n",
        "her to her feet, grunting: \"I guess it's time to go!\"\n",
        "Too bemused with terror to be fully aware of what was going on, the girl suffered herself to be led across\n",

        "startled yelp and would have fallen but for Conan's massive arm about her. Growling an objurgation in\n",
        "her ear, he snatched her up under his free arm and swept her, in a flutter of limply waving arms and legs,\n",
        "across the arch and into the aperture that opened at the other end. Without bothering to set her on her\n",
        "feet, he hurried through the short tunnel into which this aperture opened. An instant later they emerged\n",

        "though burdened with the jewels and the girl; although he doubted if even he, unburdened, could have\n",
        "ascended at that spot. He set the chest, still smeared with Gorulga's blood and clotted with his brains, on\n",
        "the ledge, and was about to remove his girdle in order to tie the box to his back, when he was galvanized\n",
        "by a sound behind him, a sound sinister and unmistakable.\n",
        "\"Stay here!\" he snapped at the bewildered Corinthian girl. \"Don't move!\" And drawing his sword, he\n",
        "glided into the tunnel, glaring back into the cavern.\n",
        "Half-way across the upper span he saw a gray deformed shape. One of the servants of Bit-Yakin was on\n",
        "his trail. There was no doubt that the brute had seen them and was following them. Conan did not\n",
        "hesitate. It might be easier to defend the mouth of the tunnel--but this fight must be finished quickly,\n",
        "before the other servants could return.\n",
        "He ran out on the span, straight toward the oncoming monster. It was no ape, neither was it a man. It was\n",
        "some shambling horror spawned in the mysterious, nameless jungles of the south, where strange life\n",
        "teemed in the reeking rot without the dominance of man, and drums thundered in temples that had\n",
        "never known the tread of a human foot. How the ancient Pelishti had gained lordship over them--and\n",
        "with it eternal exile from humanity--was a foul riddle about which Conan did not care to speculate, even\n",
        "if he had had opportunity.\n",
        "Man and monster, they met at the highest arch of the span, where, a hundred feet below, rushed the\n",
        "furious black water. As the monstrous shape with it leprous gray body and the features of a carven,\n",
        "unhuman idol loomed over him, Conan struck as a wounded tiger strikes, with every ounce of thew and\n",
        "fury behind the blow. That stroke would have sheared a human body asunder; but the bones of the\n",
        "servant of Bit-Yakin were like tempered steel. Yet even tempered steel could not wholly have withstood\n",
        "that furious stroke. Ribs and shoulder-bone parted and blood spouted from the great gash.\n",
        "There was no time for a second stroke. Before the Cimmerian could lift his blade again or spring clear, the\n",
        "sweep of a giant arm knocked him from the span as a fly is flicked from a wall. As he plunged downward\n",
        "the rush of the river was like a knell in his ears, but his twisting body fell half-way across the lower arch.\n",
        "He wavered there precariously for one blood-chilling instant, then his clutching fingers hooked over the\n",
        "farther edge, and he scrambled to safety, his sword still in his other hand.\n",
        "As he sprang up, he saw the monster, spurting blood hideously, rush toward the cliff-end of the bridge,\n",
        "obviously intending to descend the stair that connected the arches and renew the feud. At the very ledge\n",
        "the brute paused in mid-flight--and Conan saw it too--Muriela, with the jewel chest under her arm, stood\n",
        "staring wildly in the mouth of the tunnel.\n",
        "With a triumphant bellow the monster scooped her up under one arm, snatched the jewel chest with the\n",
        "other hand as she dropped it, and turning, lumbered back across the bridge. Conan cursed with passion\n",
        "and ran for the other side also. He doubted if he could climb the stair to the higher arch in time to catch\n",
        "the brute before it could plunge into the labyrinths of tunnels on the other side.\n",
        "But the monster was slowing, like clockwork running down. Blood gushed from that terrible gash in his\n",
        "breast, and he lurched drunkenly from side to side. Suddenly he stumbled, reeled and toppled sidewise--\n",
        "Jewels of Gwahlur\n",
        "335\n",
        "pitched headlong from the arch and hurtled downward. Girl and jewel chest fell from his nerveless hands\n",
        "and Muriela's scream rang terribly above the snarl of the water below.\n",
        "Conan was almost under the spot from which the creature had fallen. The monster struck the lower arch\n",
        "glancingly and shot off, but the writhing figure of the girl struck and clung, and the chest hit the edge of\n",

        "arm's length; for the fraction of a split second the chest teetered on the edge of the bridge, and Muriela\n",
        "clung by one arm, her face turned desperately toward Conan, her eyes dilated with the fear of death and\n",
        "her lips parted in a haunting cry of despair.\n",
        "Conan did not hesitate, nor did he even glance toward the chest that held the wealth of an epoch. With a\n",
        "quickness that would have shamed the spring of a hungry jaguar, he swooped, grasped the girl's arm just\n",
        "as her fingers slipped from the smooth stone, and snatched her up on the span with one explosive heave.\n",
        "The chest toppled on over and struck the water ninety feet below, where the body of the servant of BitYakin had already vanished. A splash, a jetting flash of foam marked where the Teeth of Gwahlur\n",
        "disappeared for ever from the sight of man.\n",
        "Conan scarcely wasted a downward glance. He darted across the span and ran up the cliff stair like a cat,\n",
        "carrying the limp girl as if she had been an infant. A hideous ululation caused him to glance over his\n",
        "shoulder as he reached the higher arch, to see the other servants streaming back into the cavern below,\n",
        "blood dripping from their bared fangs. They raced up the stair that wound up from tier to tier, roaring\n",
        "vengefully; but he slung the girl unceremoniously over his shoulder, dashed through the tunnel and went\n",
        "down the cliffs like an ape himself, dropping and springing from hold to hold with breakneck\n",
        "recklessness. When the fierce countenances looked over the ledge of the aperture, it was to see the\n",

        "\"Well,\" said Conan, setting the girl on her feet within the sheltering screen of branches, \"we can take our\n",

        "\"You mean you're going to keep me? Take me with you?\" she asked hopefully.\n",

        "wondering what he had heard, and wondering if indeed he had heard anything. The silence seemed\n",
        "absolute. Not a squirrel chattered or bird chirped. Then his gaze fixed itself on a mass of bushes beside\n",

        "on his scalp prickled, and he stood for an instant undecided, certain that a move in either direction would\n",
        "bring death streaking at him from the bushes.\n",

        "that head-piece. Nor was the face below it that of a civilized man: dark, scarred, with smoldering blue\n",

        "sword was thrust into the girdle of the loin-cloth, and one hand still gripped a heavy black bow. The man\n",
        "had long black hair; that was about all the wayfarer could tell about his head, for his features were a\n",
        "mask of blood and brains. His skull had been split to the teeth.\n",

        "\"You're only four miles east of Black River,\" the stranger informed him. \"They've been shot within a mile\n",

        "trail three miles south of the fort this morning, and I've been following him ever since. I came up behind\n",

        "339\n",
        "\"My name is Balthus,\" he offered. \"I was at Velitrium last night. I haven't decided whether I'll take up a\n",
        "hide of land, or enter fort service.\"\n",
        "\"The best land near Thunder River is already taken,\" grunted the slayer. \"Plenty of good land between\n",
        "Scalp Creek--you crossed it a few miles back--and the fort, but that's getting too devilish close to the river.\n",
        "The Picts steal over to burn and murder--as that one did. They don't always come singly. Some day they'll\n",
        "try to sweep the settlers out of Conajohara. And they may succeed--probably will succeed. This\n",
        "colonization business is mad, anyway. There's plenty of good land east of the Bossonian marches. If the\n",
        "Aquilonians would cut up some of the big estates of their barons, and plant wheat where now only deer\n",
        "are hunted, they wouldn't have to cross the border and take the land of the Picts away from them.\"\n",
        "\"That's queer talk from a man in the service of the governor of Conajohara,\" objected Balthus.\n",
        "\"It's nothing to me,\" the other retorted. \"I'm a mercenary. I sell my sword to the highest bidder. I never\n",
        "planted wheat and never will, so long as there are other harvests to be reaped with the sword. But you\n",
        "Hyborians have expanded as far as you'll be allowed to expand. You've crossed the marches, burned a\n",
        "few villages, exterminated a few clans and pushed back the frontier to Black River; but I doubt if you'll\n",
        "even be able to hold what you've conquered, and you'll never push the frontier any further westward.\n",
        "Your idiotic king doesn't understand conditions here. He won't send you enough reinforcements, and\n",
        "there are not enough settlers to withstand the shock of a concerted attack from across the river.\"\n",
        "\"But the Picts are divided into small clans,\" persisted Balthus. \"They'll never unite. We can whip any\n",
        "single clan.\"\n",
        "\"Or any three or four clans,\" admitted the slayer. \"But some day a man will rise and unite thirty or forty\n",
        "clans, just as was done among the Cimmerians, when the Gundermen tried to push the border northward,\n",
        "years ago. They tried to colonize the southern marches of Cimmeria: destroyed a few small clans, built a\n",
        "fort-town, Venarium--you've heard the tale.\"\n",
        "\"So I have indeed,\" replied Balthus, wincing. The memory of that red disaster was a black blot in the\n",
        "chronicles of a proud and warlike people. \"My uncle was at Venarium when the Cimmerians swarmed\n",
        "over the walls. He was one of the few who escaped that slaughter. I've heard him tell the tale, many a\n",
        "time. The barbarians swept out of the hills in a ravening horde, without warning, and stormed Venarium\n",
        "with such fury none could stand before them. Men, women, and children were butchered. Venarium was\n",
        "reduced to a mass of charred ruins, as it is to this day. The Aquilonians were driven back across the\n",
        "marches, and have never since tried to colonize the Cimmerian country. But you speak of Venarium\n",
        "familiarly. Perhaps you were there?\"\n",
        "\"I was,\" grunted the other. \"I was one of the horde that swarmed over the walls. I hadn't yet seen fifteen\n",
        "snows, but already my name was repeated about the council fires.\"\n",
        "Balthus involuntarily recoiled, staring. It seemed incredible that the man walking tranquilly at his side\n",
        "should have been one of those screeching, blood-mad devils that poured over the walls of Venarium on\n",
        "that long-gone day to make her streets run crimson.\n",
        "\"Then you, too, are a barbarian!\" he exclaimed involuntarily.\n",
        "The other nodded, without taking offense.\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "340\n",
        "\"I am Conan, a Cimmerian.\"\n",
        "\"I've heard of you.\" Fresh interest quickened Balthus' gaze. No wonder the Pict had fallen victim to his\n",
        "own sort of subtlety! The Cimmerians were barbarians as ferocious as the Picts, and much more\n",
        "intelligent. Evidently Conan had spent much time among civilized men, though that contact had\n",
        "obviously not softened him, nor weakened any of his primitive instincts. Balthus' apprehension turned to\n",
        "admiration as he marked the easy catlike stride, the effortless silence with which the Cimmerian moved\n",
        "along the trail. The oiled links of his armor did not clink, and Balthus knew Conan could glide through\n",
        "the deepest thicket or most tangled copse as noiselessly as any naked Pict that ever lived.\n",
        "\"You're not a Gunderman?\" It was more assertion than question.\n",
        "Balthus shook his head. \"I'm from the Tauran.\"\n",
        "\"I've seen good woodsmen from the Tauran. But the Bossonians have sheltered you Aquilonians from the\n",
        "outer wilderness for too many centuries. You need hardening.\"\n",
        "That was true; the Bossonian marches, with their fortifed villages filled with determined bowmen, had\n",
        "long served Aquilonia as a buffer against the outlying barbarians. Now among the settlers beyond\n",
        "Thunder River here was growing up a breed of forest men capable of meeting the barbarians at their own\n",
        "game, but their numbers were still scanty. Most of the frontiersmen were like Balthus--more of the settler\n",
        "than the woodsman type.\n",
        "The sun had not set, but it was no longer in sight, hidden as it was behind the dense forest wall. The\n",
        "shadows were lengthening, deepening back in the woods as the companions strode on down the trail.\n",
        "\"It will be dark before we reach the fort,\" commented Conan casually; then: \"Listen!\"\n",
        "He stopped short, half crouching, sword ready, transformed into a savage figure of suspicion and menace,\n",
        "poised to spring and rend. Balthus had heard it too--a wild scream that broke at its highest note. It was\n",
        "the cry of a man in dire fear or agony.\n",
        "Conan was off in an instant, racing down the trail, each stride widening the distance between him and his\n",
        "straining companion. Balthus puffed a curse. Among the settlements of the Tauran he was accounted a\n",
        "good runner, but Conan was leaving him behind with maddening ease. Then Balthus forgot his\n",

        "clad in the gilt-worked boots and (despite the heat) the ermine-trimmed tunic of a wealthy merchant. His\n",
        "fat, pale face was set in a stare of frozen horror; his thick throat had been slashed from ear to ear as if by a\n",
        "razor-sharp blade. The short sword still in its scabbard seemed to indicate that he had been struck down\n",
        "without a chance to fight for his life.\n",
        "\"A Pict?\" Balthus whispered, as he turned to peer into the deepening shadows of the forest.\n",
        "Conan shook his head and straightened to scowl down at the dead man.\n",
        "\"A forest devil. This is the fifth, by Crom!\"\n",
        "\"What do you mean?\"\n",
        "\"Did you ever hear of a Pictish wizard called Zogar Sag?\"\n",

        "mules belonged to this man\"--Conan casually indicated the corpse with his foot--\"Tiberias, a merchant of\n",
        "Velitrium. They were loaded with ale-kegs, and old Zogar stopped to guzzle before he got across the\n",
        "river. A woodsman named Soractus trailed him, and led Valannus and three soldiers to where he lay\n",
        "dead drunk in a thicket. At the importunities of Tiberias, Valannus threw Zogar Sag into a cell, which is\n",
        "the worst insult you can give a Pict. He managed to kill his guard and escape, and sent back word that he\n",
        "meant to kill Tiberias and the five men who captured him in a way that would make Aquilonians\n",
        "shudder for centuries to come.\n",
        "\"Well, Soractus and the soldiers are dead. Soractus was killed on the river, the soldiers in the very\n",
        "shadow of the fort. And now Tiberias is dead. No Pict killed any of them. Each victim--except Tiberias, as\n",
        "you see--lacked his head--which no doubt is now ornamenting the altar of Zogar Sag's particular god.\"\n",
        "\"How do you know they weren't killed by the Picts?\" demanded Balthus.\n",
        "Conan pointed to the corpse of the merchant.\n",
        "\"You think that was done with a knife or a sword? Look closer and you'll see that only a talon could have\n",
        "made a gash like that. The flesh is ripped, not cut.\"\n",
        "\"Perhaps a panther--\" began Balthus, without conviction.\n",
        "Conan shook his head impatiently.\n",
        "\"A man from the Tauran couldn't mistake the mark of a panther's claws. No. It's a forest devil summoned\n",
        "by Zogar Sag to carry out his revenge. Tiberias was a fool to start for Velitrium alone, and so close to\n",
        "dusk. But each one of the victims seemed to be smitten with madness just before doom overtook him.\n",
        "Look here; the signs are plain enough. Tiberias came riding along the trail on his mule, maybe with a\n",
        "bundle of choice otter pelts behind his saddle to sell in Velitrium, and the thing sprang on him from\n",
        "behind that bush. See where the branches are crushed down.\n",

        "342\n",
        "\"Tiberias gave one scream, and then his throat was torn open and he was selling his otter skins in Hell.\n",

        "The demon didn't have time to take Tiberias' head; it took fright as we came up.\"\n",
        "\"As you came up,\" amended Balthus. \"It must not be a very terrible creature if it flees from one armed\n",

        "you see it?\"\n",
        "\"Tiberias was an armed man,\" grunted Conan. \"If Zogar Sag can bring demons to aid him, he can tell\n",
        "them which men to kill and which to let alone. No, I didn't see it. I only saw the bushes shake as it left the\n",

        "The slayer had stepped into the pool of blood in which the dead man sprawled. Under the bushes at the\n",

        "\"Did a man make that?\" demanded Conan.\n",
        "Balthus felt his scalp prickle. Neither man nor any beast that he had ever seen could have left that strange,\n",
        "monstrous, three-toed print, that was curiously combined of the bird and the reptile, yet a true type of\n",
        "neither. He spread his fingers above the print, careful not to touch it, and grunted explosively. He could\n",
        "not span the mark.\n",
        "\"What is it?\" he whispered. \"I never saw a beast that left a spoor like that.\"\n",
        "\"Nor any other sane man,\" answered Conan grimly. \"It's a swamp demon--they're thick as bats in the\n",
        "swamps beyond Black River. You can hear them howling like damned souls when the wind blows strong\n",
        "from the south on hot nights.\"\n",
        "\"What shall we do?\" asked the Aquilonian, peering uneasily into the deep blue shadows. The frozen fear\n",
        "on the dead countenance haunted him. He wondered what hideous head the wretch had seen thrust\n",
        "grinning from among the leaves to chill his blood with terror.\n",
        "\"No use to try to follow a demon,\" grunted Conan, drawing a short woodman's ax from his girdle. \"I tried\n",
        "tracking him after he killed Soractus. I lost his trail within a dozen steps. He might have grown himself\n",
        "wings and flown away, or sunk down through the earth to Hell. I don't know. I'm not going after the\n",
        "mule, either. It'll either wander back to the fort, or to some settler's cabin.\"\n",
        "As he spoke Conan was busy at the edge of the trail with his ax. With a few strokes he cut a pair of\n",
        "saplings nine or ten feet long, and denuded them of their branches. Then he cut a length from a serpentlike vine that crawled among the bushes near by, and making one end fast to one of the poles, a couple of\n",
        "feet from the end, whipped the vine over the other sapling and interlaced it back and forth. In a few\n",
        "moments he had a crude but strong litter.\n",
        "\"The demon isn't going to get Tiberias' head if I can help it,\" he growled. \"We'll carry the body into the\n",

        "cursed free with white men's heads.\"\n",
        "The Picts were a white race, though swarthy, but the border men never spoke of them as such.\n",

        "343\n",
        "Balthus took the rear end of the litter, onto which Conan unceremoniously dumped the unfortunate\n",
        "merchant, and they moved on down the trail as swiftly as possible. Conan made no more noise laden\n",
        "with their grim burden than he had made when unencumbered. He had made a loop with the merchant's\n",
        "belt at the end of the poles, and was carrying his share of the load with one hand, while the other gripped\n",
        "his naked broadsword, and his restless gaze roved the sinister walls about them. The shadows were\n",
        "thickening. A darkening blue mist blurred the outlines of the foliage. The forest deepened in the twilight,\n",
        "became a blue haunt of mystery sheltering unguessed things.\n",
        "They had covered more than a mile, and the muscles in Balthus' sturdy arms were beginning to ache a\n",
        "little, when a cry rang shuddering from the woods whose blue shadows were deepening into purple.\n",
        "Conan started convulsively, and Balthus almost let go the poles.\n",
        "\"A woman!\" cried the younger man. \"Great Mitra, a woman cried out then!\"\n",
        "\"A settler's wife straying in the woods,\" snarled Conan, setting down his end of the lifter. \"Looking for a\n",
        "cow, probably, and--stay here!\"\n",
        "He dived like a hunting wolf into the leafy wall. Balthus' hair bristled.\n",
        "\"Stay here alone with this corpse and a devil hiding in the woods?\" he yelped. \"I'm coming with you!\"\n",
        "And suiting action to words, he plunged after the Cimmerian. Conan glanced back at him, but made no\n",
        "objection, though he did not moderate his pace to accommodate the shorter legs of his companion.\n",
        "Balthus wasted his wind in swearing as the Cimmerian drew away from him again, like a phantom\n",
        "between the trees, and then Conan burst into a dim glade and halted crouching, lips snarling, sword\n",
        "lifted.\n",
        "\"What are we stopping for?\" panted Balthus, dashing the sweat out of his eyes and gripping his short\n",
        "sword.\n",
        "\"That scream came from this glade, or near by,\" answered Conan. \"I don't mistake the location of sounds,\n",
        "even in the woods. But where--\"\n",
        "Abruptly the sound rang out again--behind them; in the direction of the trail they had just quitted. It rose\n",
        "piercingly and pitifully, the cry of a woman in frantic terror--and then, shockingly, it changed to a yell of\n",
        "mocking laughter that might have burst from the lips of a fiend of lower Hell.\n",
        "\"What in Mitra's name--\" Balthus' face was a pale blur in the gloom.\n",
        "With a scorching oath Conan wheeled and dashed back the way he had come, and the Aquilonian\n",
        "stumbled bewilderedly after him. He blundered into the Cimmerian as the latter stopped dead, and\n",
        "rebounded from his brawny shoulders as though from an iron statue. Gasping from the impact, he heard\n",
        "Conan's breath hiss through his teeth. The Cimmerian seemed frozen in his tracks.\n",
        "Looking over his shoulder, Balthus felt his hair stand up stiffly. Something was moving through the deep\n",
        "bushes that fringed the trail--something that neither walked nor flew, but seemed to glide like a serpent.\n",
        "But it was not a serpent. Its outlines were indistinct, but it was taller than a man, and not very bulky. It\n",
        "gave off a glimmer of weird light, like a faint blue flame. Indeed, the eery fire was the only tangible thing \n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "344\n",
        "about it. It might have been an embodied flame moving with reason and purpose through the blackening\n",
        "woods.\n",
        "Conan snarled a savage curse and hurled his ax with ferocious will. But the thing glided on without\n",
        "altering its course. Indeed it was only a few instants' fleeting glimpse they had of it--a tall, shadowy thing\n",
        "of misty flame floating through the thickets. Then it was gone, and the forest crouched in breathless\n",
        "stillness.\n",
        "With a snarl Conan plunged through the intervening foliage and into the trail. His profanity, as Balthus\n",
        "floundered after him, was lurid and impassioned. The Cimmerian was standing over the litter on which\n",
        "lay the body of Tiberias. And that body no longer possessed a head.\n",
        "\"Tricked us with its damnable caterwauling!\" raved Conan, swinging his great sword about his head in\n",
        "his wrath. \"I might have known! I might have guessed a trick! Now there'll be five heads to decorate\n",
        "Zogar's altar.\"\n",
        "\"But what thing is it that can cry like a woman and laugh like a devil, and shines like witch-fire as it\n",
        "glides through the trees?\" gasped Balthus, mopping the sweat from his pale face.\n",
        "\"A swamp devil,\" responded Conan morosely. \"Grab those poles. We'll take in the body, anyway. At least\n",
        "our load's a bit lighter.\"\n",

        "menacing figure appeared, but the sentries knew that they too were watched, fiercely, hungrily, with the\n",
        "mercilessness of ancient hate. The forest beyond the river might seem desolate and vacant of life to the\n",

        "all the hunting beasts.\n",
        "There, at the fort, civilization ended. Fort Tuscelan was the last outpost of a civilized world; it represented\n",

        "shadowy forests, brush-thatched huts where hung the grinning skulls of men, and mud-walled\n",
        "enclosures where fires flickered and drums rumbled, and spears were whetted in the hands of dark, silent\n",
        "men with tangled black hair and the eyes of serpents. Those eyes often glared through bushes at the fort\n",
        "across the river. Once dark-skinned men had built their huts where that fort stood, yes, and their huts \n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "345\n",
        "had risen where now stood the fields and log cabins of fair-haired settlers, back beyond Velitrium, that\n",

        "The gate swung inward and Conan and his companion passed through. Balthus noted that the gate was\n",

        "Conan grunted enigmatically, motioned Balthus to ease the litter to the ground, and then strode off\n",
        "toward the governor's quarters, with the Aquilonian at his heels. The tousle-headed youth stared about\n",
        "him eagerly and curiously, noting the rows of barracks along the walls, the stables, the tiny merchants'\n",
        "stalls, the towering blockhouse, and the other buildings, with the open square in the middle where the\n",
        "soldiers drilled, and where, now, fires danced and men off duty lounged. These were now hurrying to\n",

        "countenance already carved into sober cast by toil and responsibility.\n",
        "\"You left the fort before daybreak, I was told,\" he said to Conan. \"I had begun to fear that the Picts had\n",

        "\"When they smoke my head the whole river will know,\" grunted Conan. \"They'll hear Pictish women\n",
        "wailing their dead as far as Velitrium--I was on a lone scout. I couldn't sleep. I kept hearing drums talking\n",

        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "346\n",
        "\"They talk each night,\" reminded the governor, his fine eyes shadowed, as he stared closely at Conan. He\n",
        "had learned the unwisdom of discounting wild men's instincts.\n",
        "\"There was a difference last night,\" growled Conan. \"There has been ever since Zogar Sag got back across\n",
        "the river.\"\n",
        "\"We should either have given him presents and sent him home, or else hanged him,\" sighed the governor.\n",
        "\"You advised that, but--\"\n",
        "\"But it's hard for you Hyborians to learn the ways of the outlands,\" said Conan. \"Well, it can't be helped\n",
        "now, but there'll be no peace on the border so long as Zogar lives and remembers the cell he sweated in. I\n",
        "was following a warrior who slipped over to put a few white notches on his bow. After I split his head I\n",

        "Valannus approvingly eyed the young man's frank countenance and strongly-knit frame.\n",
        "\"I am glad to welcome you, young sir. I wish more of your people would come. We need men used to\n",
        "forest life. Many of our soldiers and some of our settlers are from the eastern provinces and know\n",
        "nothing of woodcraft, or even of agricultural life.\"\n",
        "\"Not many of that breed this side of Velitrium,\" grunted Conan. \"That town's full of them, though. But\n",
        "listen, Valannus, we found Tiberias dead on the trail.\" And in a few words he related the grisly affair.\n",
        "Valannus paled. \"I did not know he had left the fort. He must have been mad!\"\n",
        "\"He was,\" answered Conan. \"Like the other four; each one, when his time came, went mad and rushed\n",
        "into the woods to meet his death like a hare running down the throat of a python. Something called to\n",
        "them from the deeps of the forest, something the men call a loon, for lack of a better name, but only the\n",
        "doomed ones could hear it. Zogar Sag has made a magic that Aquilonian civilization can't overcome.\"\n",
        "To this thrust Valannus made no reply; he wiped his brow with a shaky hand.\n",
        "\"Do the soldiers know of this?\"\n",
        "\"We left the body by the eastern gate.\"\n",
        "\"You should have concealed the fact, hidden the corpse somewhere in the woods. The soldiers are\n",
        "nervous enough already.\"\n",
        "\"They'd have found it out some way. If I'd hidden the body, it would have been returned to the fort as the\n",

        "Valannus shuddered. Turning, he walked to a casement and stared silently out over the river, black and\n",
        "shiny under the glint of the stars. Beyond the river the jungle rose like an ebony wall. The distant screech\n",
        "of a panther broke the stillness. The night pressed in, blurring the sounds of the soldiers outside the\n",
        "blockhouse, dimming the fires. A wind whispered through the black branches, rippling the dusky water.\n",
        "On its wings came a low, rhythmic pulsing, sinister as the pad of a leopard's foot.\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "347\n",
        "\"After all,\" said Valannus, as if speaking his thoughts aloud, \"what do we know--what does anyone\n",
        "know--of the things that jungle may hide? We have dim rumors of great swamps and rivers, and a forest\n",
        "that stretches on and on over everlasting plains and hills to end at last on the shores of the western ocean.\n",
        "But what things lie between this river and that ocean we dare not even guess. No white man has ever\n",
        "plunged deep into that fastness and returned alive to tell us what be found. We are wise in our civilized\n",
        "knowledge, but our knowledge extends just so far--to the western bank of that ancient river! Who knows\n",
        "what shapes earthly and unearthly may lurk beyond the dim circle of light our knowledge has cast?\n",
        "\"Who knows what gods are worshipped under the shadows of that heathen forest, or what devils crawl\n",
        "out of the black ooze of the swamps? Who can be sure that all the inhabitants of that black country are\n",
        "natural? Zogar Sag--a sage of the eastern cities would sneer at his primitive magic-making as the\n",
        "mummery of a fakir; yet he has driven mad and killed five men in a manner no man can explain. I\n",
        "wonder if he himself is wholly human.\"\n",
        "\"If I can get within ax-throwing distance of him I'll settle that question,\" growled Conan, helping himself\n",
        "to the governor's wine and pushing a glass toward Balthus, who took it hesitatingly, and with an\n",
        "uncertain glance toward Valannus.\n",
        "The governor turned toward Conan and stared at him thoughtfully.\n",
        "\"The soldiers, who do not believe in ghosts or devils,\" he said, \"are almost in a panic of fear. You, who\n",
        "believe in ghosts, ghouls, goblins, and all manner of uncanny things, do not seem to fear any of the things\n",
        "in which you believe.\"\n",
        "\"There's nothing in the universe cold steel won't cut,\" answered Conan. \"I threw my ax at the demon, and\n",
        "he took no hurt, but I might have missed in the dusk, or a branch deflected its flight. I'm not going out of\n",
        "my way looking for devils; but I wouldn't step out of my path to let one go by.\"\n",

        "unreal in the dim light. But there was nothing unreal about the low-hung savage head, and the great\n",

        "almost as bulky as a bear. Its shoulders and forelegs were so massive and mightily muscled as to give it a\n",
        "curiously top-heavy look, though its hindquarters were more powerful than that of a lion. Its jaws were\n",
        "massive, but its head was brutishly shaped. Its brain capacity was small. It had room for no instincts\n",

        "of fangs and talons.\n",
        "This was the monstrosity Zogar Sag had summoned out of the forest. Balthus no longer doubted the\n",

        "burned greenly in the wide, unwinking eyes; the hunger not alone of belly-emptiness, but the lust of\n",

        "and its palely gleaming barrel rippling out behind it. A forked tongue darted in and out, and the firelight\n",
        "glittered on bared fangs.\n",
        "Balthus became incapable of emotion. The horror of his fate paralyzed him. That was the reptile that the\n",
        "ancients called Ghost Snake, the pale, abominable terror that of old glided into huts by night to devour\n",
        "whole families. Like the python it crushed its victim, but unlike other constrictors its fangs bore venom \n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "354\n",
        "that carried madness and death. It too had long been considered extinct. But Valannus had spoken truly.\n",
        "No white man knew what shapes haunted the great forests beyond Black River.\n",
        "It came on silently, rippling over the ground, its hideous head on the same level, its neck curving back\n",
        "slightly for the strike. Balthus gazed with a glazed, hypnotized stare into that loathsome gullet down\n",
        "which he would soon be engulfed, and he was aware of no sensation except a vague nausea.\n",
        "And then something that glinted in the firelight streaked from the shadows of the huts, and the great\n",
        "reptile whipped about and went into instant convulsions. As in a dream Balthus saw a short throwingspear transfixing the mighty neck, just below the gaping jaws; the shaft protruded from one side, the steel\n",
        "head from the other.\n",
        "Knotting and looping hideously, the maddened reptile rolled into the circle of men who stove back from\n",
        "him. The spear had not severed its spine, but merely transfixed its great neck muscles. Its furiously\n",
        "lashing tail mowed down a dozen men and its jaws snapped convulsively, splashing others with venom\n",
        "that burned like liquid fire. Howling, cursing, screaming, frantic, they scattered before it, knocking each\n",
        "other down in their flight, trampling the fallen, bursting through the huts. The giant snake rolled into a\n",
        "fire, scattering sparks and brands, and the pain lashed it to more frenzied efforts. A hut wall buckled\n",
        "under the ram-like impact of its flailing tail, disgorging howling people.\n",
        "Men stampeded through the fires, knocking the logs right and left. The flames sprang up, then sank. A\n",
        "reddish dim glow was all that lighted that nightmare scene where the giant reptile whipped and rolled,\n",
        "and men clawed and shrieked in frantic flight.\n",
        "Balthus felt something jerk at his wrists, and then, miraculously, he was free, and a strong hand dragged\n",
        "him behind the post. Dazedly he saw Conan, felt the forest man's iron grip on his arm.\n",
        "There was blood on the Cimmerian's mail, dried blood on the sword in his right hand; he loomed dim\n",
        "and gigantic in the shadowy light.\n",
        "\"Come on! Before they get over their panic!\"\n",
        "Balthus felt the haft of an ax shoved into his hand. Zogar Sag had disappeared. Conan dragged Balthus\n",
        "after him until the youth's numb brain awoke, and his legs began to move of their own accord. Then\n",
        "Conan released him and ran into the building where the skulls hung. Balthus followed him. He got a\n",
        "glimpse of a grim stone altar, faintly lighted by the glow outside; five human heads grinned on that altar,\n",
        "and there was a grisly familiarity about the features of the freshest; it was the head of the merchant\n",
        "Tiberias. Behind the altar was an idol, dim, indistinct, bestial, yet vaguely man-like in outline. Then fresh\n",
        "horror choked Balthus as the shape heaved up suddenly with a rattle of chains, lifting long, misshapen\n",
        "arms in the gloom.\n",
        "Conan's sword flailed down, crunching through flesh and bone, and then the Cimmerian was dragging\n",
        "Balthus around the altar, past a huddled shaggy bulk on the floor, to a door at the back of the long hut.\n",
        "Through this they burst, out into the enclosure again. But a few yards beyond them loomed the stockade.\n",
        "It was dark behind the altar-hut. The mad stampede of the Picts had not carried them in that direction. At\n",
        "the wall Conan halted, gripped Balthus, and heaved him at arm's length into the air as he might have\n",
        "lifted a child. Balthus grasped the points of the upright logs set in the sun-dried mud and scrambled up \n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "355\n",
        "on them, ignoring the havoc done his skin. He lowered a hand to the Cimmerian, when around a corner\n",
        "of the altar-hut sprang a fleeing Pict. He halted short, glimpsing the man on the wall in the faint glow of\n",
        "the fires. Conan hurled his ax with deadly aim, but the warrior's mouth was already open for a yell of\n",
        "warning, and it rang loud above the din, cut short as he dropped with a shattered skull.\n",
        "Blinding terror had not submerged all ingrained instincts. As that wild yell rose above the clamor, there\n",
        "was an instant's lull, and then a hundred throats bayed ferocious answer and warriors came leaping to\n",
        "repel the attack presaged by the warning.\n",
        "Conan leaped high, caught, not Balthus' hand but his arm near the shoulder, and swung himself up.\n",
        "Balthus set his teeth against the strain, and then the Cimmerian was on the wall beside him, and the\n",
        "fugitives dropped down on the other side.\n",
        "V\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Which way is the river?\" Balthus was confused.\n",
        "\"We don't dare try for the river now,\" grunted Conan. \"The woods between the village and the river are\n",
        "swarming with warriors. Come on! We'll head in the last direction they'll expect us to go--west!\"\n",
        "Looking back as they entered the thick growth, Balthus beheld the wall dotted with black heads as the\n",
        "savages peered over. The Picts were bewildered. They had not gained the wall in time to see the fugitives\n",
        "take cover. They had rushed to the wall expecting to repel an attack in force. They had seen the body of\n",
        "the dead warrior. But no enemy was in sight.\n",
        "Balthus realized that they did not yet know their prisoner had escaped. From other sounds he believed\n",
        "that the warriors, directed by the shrill voice of Zogar Sag, were destroying the wounded serpent with\n",
        "arrows. The monster was out of the shaman's control. A moment later the quality of the yells was altered.\n",
        "Screeches of rage rose in the night.\n",
        "Conan laughed grimly. He was leading Balthus along a narrow trail that ran west under the black\n",
        "branches, stepping as swiftly and surely as if he trod a well-lighted thoroughfare. Balthus stumbled after\n",
        "him, guiding himself by feeling the dense wall on either hand.\n",
        "\"They'll be after us now. Zogar's discovered you're gone, and he knows my head wasn't in the pile before\n",
        "the altar-hut. The dog! If I'd had another spear I'd have thrown it through him before I struck the snake.\n",
        "Keep to the trail. They can't track us by torchlight, and there are a score of paths leading from the village.\n",
        "They'll follow those leading to the river first--throw a cordon of warriors for miles along the bank,\n",
        "expecting us to try to break through. We won't take to the woods until we have to. We can make better\n",
        "time on this trail. Now buckle down to it and run was you never ran before.\"\n",
        "\"They got over their panic cursed quick!\" panted Balthus, complying with a fresh burst of speed.\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "356\n",
        "\"They're not afraid of anything, very long,\" grunted Conan.\n",
        "For a space nothing was said between them. The fugitives devoted all their attention to covering distance.\n",
        "They were plunging deeper and deeper into the wilderness and getting farther away from civilization at\n",
        "every step, but Balthus did not question Conan's wisdom. The Cimmerian presently took time to grunt:\n",
        "\"When we're far enough away from the village we'll swing back to the river in a big circle. No other\n",
        "village within miles of Gwawela. All the Picts are gathered in that vicinity. We'll circle wide around them.\n",
        "They can't track us until daylight. They'll pick up our path then, but before dawn we'll leave the trail and\n",
        "take to the woods.\"\n",
        "They plunged on. The yells died out behind them. Balthus' breath was whistling through his teeth. He felt\n",
        "a pain in his side, and running became torture. He blundered against the bushes on each side of the trail.\n",
        "Conan pulled up suddenly, turned and stared back down the dim path.\n",
        "Somewhere the moon was rising, a dim white glow amidst a tangle of branches.\n",
        "\"Shall we take to the woods?\" panted Balthus.\n",
        "\"Give me your ax,\" murmured Conan softly. \"Something is close behind us.\"\n",
        "\"Then we'd better leave the trail!\" exclaimed Balthus. Conan shook his head and drew his companion into\n",
        "a dense thicket. The moon rose higher, making a dim light in the path.\n",
        "\"We can't fight the whole tribe!\" whispered Balthus.\n",
        "\"No human being could have found our trail so quickly, or followed us so swiftly,\" muttered Conan.\n",
        "\"Keep silent.\"\n",
        "There followed a tense silence in which Balthus felt that his heart could be heard pounding for miles\n",
        "away. Then abruptly, without a sound to announce its coming, a savage head appeared in the dim path.\n",
        "Balthus' heart jumped into his throat; at first glance he feared to look upon the awful head of the sabertooth. But this head was smaller, more narrow; it was a leopard which stood there, snarling silently and\n",
        "glaring down the trail. What wind there was was blowing toward the hiding men, concealing their scent.\n",
        "The beast lowered his head and snuffed the trail, then moved forward uncertainly. A chill played down\n",
        "Balthus' spine. The brute was undoubtedly trailing them.\n",
        "And it was suspicious. It lifted its head, its eyes glowing like balls of fire, and growled low in its throat.\n",
        "And at that instant Conan hurled the ax.\n",
        "All the weight of arm and shoulder was behind the throw, and the ax was a streak of silver in the dim\n",
        "moon. Almost before he realized what had happened, Balthus saw the leopard rolling on the ground in\n",
        "its death-throes, the handle of the ax standing up from its head. The head of the weapon had split its\n",
        "narrow skull.\n",
        "Conan bounded from the bushes, wrenched his ax free and dragged the limp body in among the trees,\n",
        "concealing it from the casual glance.\n",
        "\"Now let's go, and go fast!\" he grunted, leading the way southward, away from the trail. \"There'll be\n",
        "warriors coming after that cat. As soon as he got his wits back, Zogar sent him after us. The Picts would \n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "357\n",
        "follow him, but he'd leave them far behind. He'd circle the village until he hit our trail and then come\n",
        "after us like a streak. They couldn't keep up with him, but they'll have an idea as to our general direction.\n",
        "They'd follow, listening for his cry. Well, they won't hear that, but they'll find the blood on the trail, and\n",
        "look around and find the body in the brush. They'll pick up our spoor there, if they can. Walk with care.\"\n",
        "He avoided clinging briars and low-hanging branches effortlessly, gliding between trees without\n",
        "touching the stems and always planting his feet in the places calculated to show least evidence of his\n",
        "passing; but with Balthus it was slower, more laborious work.\n",
        "No sound came from behind them. They had covered more than a mile when Balthus said: \"Does Zogar\n",
        "Sag catch leopard-cubs and train them for bloodhounds?\"\n",
        "Conan shook his head. \"That was a leopard he called out of the woods.\"\n",
        "\"But,\" Balthus persisted, \"if he can order the beasts to do his bidding, why doesn't he rouse them all and\n",
        "have them after us? The forest is full of leopards; why send only one after us?\"\n",
        "Conan did not reply for a space, and when he did it was with a curious reticence.\n",
        "\"He can't command all the animals. Only such as remember Jhebbal Sag.\"\n",
        "\"Jhebbal Sag?\" Balthus repeated the ancient name hesitantly. He had never heard it spoken more than\n",
        "three or four times in his whole life.\n",
        "\"Once all living things worshipped him. That was long ago, when beasts and men spoke one language.\n",
        "Men have forgotten him; even the beasts forget. Only a few remember. The men who remember Jhebbal\n",
        "Sag and the beasts who remember are brothers and speak the same tongue.\"\n",
        "Balthus did not reply; he had strained at a Pictish stake and seen the nighted jungle give up its fanged\n",
        "horrors at a shaman's call.\n",
        "\"Civilized men laugh,\" said Conan. \"But not one can tell me how Zogar Sag can call pythons and tigers\n",
        "and leopards out of the wilderness and make them do his bidding. They would say it is a lie, if they\n",
        "dared. That's the way with civilized men. When they can't explain something by their half-baked science,\n",
        "they refuse to believe it.\"\n",
        "The people on the Tauran were closer to the primitive than most Aquilonians; superstitions persisted,\n",
        "whose sources were lost in antiquity. And Balthus had seen that which still prickled his flesh. He could\n",
        "not refute the monstrous thing which Conan's words implied.\n",
        "\"I've heard that there's an ancient grove sacred to Jhebbal Sag somewhere in this forest,\" said Conan. \"I\n",
        "don't know. I've never seen it. But more beasts remember in this country than any I've ever seen.\"\n",
        "\"Then others will be on our trail?\"\n",
        "\"They are now,\" was Conan's disquieting answer. \"Zogar would never leave our tracking to one beast\n",
        "alone.\"\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "358\n",
        "\"What are we to do, then?\" asked Balthus uneasily, grasping his ax as he stared at the gloomy arches\n",
        "above him. His flesh crawled with the momentary expectation of ripping talons and fangs leaping from\n",
        "the shadows.\n",
        "\"Wait!\"\n",
        "Conan turned, squatted and with his knife began scratching a curious symbol in the mold. Stooping to\n",
        "look at it over his shoulder, Balthus felt a crawling of the flesh along his spine, he knew not why. He felt\n",
        "no wind against his face, but there was a rustling of leaves above them and a weird moaning swept\n",
        "ghostily through the branches. Conan glanced up inscrutably, then rose and stood staring somberly down\n",
        "at the symbol he had drawn.\n",
        "\"What is it?\" whispered Balthus. It looked archaic and meaningless to him. He supposed that it was his\n",
        "ignorance of artistry which prevented his identifying it as one of the conventional designs of some\n",
        "prevailing culture. But had he been the most erudite artist in the world, he would have been no nearer the\n",
        "solution.\n",
        "\"I saw it carved in the rock of a cave no human had visited for a million years,\" muttered Conan, \"in the\n",
        "uninhabited mountains beyond the Sea of Vilayet, half a world away from this spot. Later I saw a black\n",
        "witch-finder of Kush scratch it in the sand of a nameless river. He told me part of its meaning--it's sacred\n",
        "to Jhebbal Sag and the creatures which worship him. Watch!\"\n",
        "They drew back among the dense foliage some yards away and waited in tense silence. To the east drums\n",
        "muttered and somewhere to north and west other drums answered. Balthus shivered, though he knew\n",
        "long miles of black forest separated him from the grim beaters of those drums, whose dull pulsing was a\n",
        "sinister overture that set the dark stage for bloody drama.\n",
        "Balthus found himself holding his breath. Then with a slight shaking of the leaves, the bushes parted and\n",
        "a magnificent panther came into view. The moonlight dappling through the leaves shone on its glossy\n",
        "coat rippling with the play of the great muscles beneath it.\n",
        "With its head low it glided toward them. It was smelling out their trail. Then it halted as if frozen, its\n",
        "muzzle almost touching the symbol cut in the mold. For a long space it crouched motionless; it flattened\n",
        "its long body and laid its head on the ground before the mark. And Balthus felt the short hairs stir on his\n",
        "scalp. For the attitude of the great carnivore was one of awe and adoration.\n",
        "Then the panther rose and backed away carefully, belly almost to the ground. With his hind-quarters\n",
        "among the bushes he wheeled as if in sudden panic and was gone like a flash of dappled light.\n",
        "Balthus mopped his brow with a trembling hand and glanced at Conan.\n",
        "The barbarian's eyes were smoldering with fires that never lit the eyes of men bred to the ideas of\n",
        "civilization. In that instant he was all wild, and had forgotten the man at his side. In his burning gaze\n",
        "Balthus glimpsed and vaguely recognized pristine images and half-embodied memories, shadows from\n",
        "Life's dawn, forgotten and repudiated by sophisticated races--ancient, primeval fantasms unnamed and\n",
        "nameless.\n",
        "Then the deeper fires were masked and Conan was silently leading the way deeper into the forest.\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "359\n",
        "\"We've no more to fear from the beasts,\" he said after a while, \"but we've left a sign for men to read. They\n",
        "won't follow our trail very easily, and until they find that symbol they won't know for sure we've turned\n",
        "south. Even then it won't be easy to smell us out without the beasts to aid them. But the woods south of\n",
        "the trail will be full of warriors looking for us. If we keep moving after daylight, we'll be sure to run into\n",
        "some of them. As soon as we find a good place we'll hide and wait until another night to swing back and\n",
        "make the river. We've got to warn Valannus, but it won't help him any if we get ourselves killed.\"\n",
        "\"Warn Valannus?\"\n",
        "\"Hell, the woods along the river are swarming with Picts! That's why they got us. Zogar's brewing warmagic; no mere raid this time. He's done something no Pict has done in my memory--united as many as\n",
        "fifteen or sixteen clans. His magic did it; they'll follow a wizard farther than they will a war-chief. You\n",
        "saw the mob in the village; and there were hundreds hiding along the river bank that you didn't see.\n",
        "More coming, from the farther villages. He'll have at least three thousand fighting-men. I lay in the\n",
        "bushes and heard their talk as they went past. They mean to attack the fort; when, I don't know, but\n",
        "Zogar doesn't dare delay long. He's gathered them and whipped them into a frenzy. If he doesn't lead\n",
        "them into battle quickly, they'll fall to quarreling with one another. They're like blood-mad tigers.\n",
        "\"I don't know whether they can take the fort or not. Anyway, we've got to get back across the river and\n",
        "give the warning. The settlers on the Velitrium road must either get into the fort or back to Velitrium.\n",
        "While the Picts are besieging the fort, war parties will range the road far to the east--might even cross\n",
        "Thunder River and raid the thickly settled country behind Velitrium.\"\n",
        "As he talked he was leading the way deeper and deeper into the ancient wilderness. Presently he grunted\n",
        "with satisfaction. They had reached a spot where the underbrush was more scattered, and an outcropping\n",
        "of stone was visible, wandering off southward. Balthus felt more secure as they followed it. Not even a\n",
        "Pict could trail them over naked rock.\n",
        "\"How did you get away?\" he asked presently.\n",
        "Conan tapped his mail-shirt and helmet.\n",
        "\"If more borderers would wear harness there'd be fewer skulls hanging on the altar-huts. But most men\n",
        "make noise if they wear armor. They were waiting on each side of the path, without moving. And when a\n",
        "Pict stands motionless, the very beasts of the forest pass him without seeing him. They'd seen us crossing\n",
        "the river and got in their places. If they'd gone into ambush after we left the bank, I'd have had some hint\n",
        "of it. But they were waiting, and not even a leaf trembled. The devil himself couldn't have suspected\n",
        "anything. The first suspicion I had was when I heard a shaft rasp against a bow as it was pulled back. I\n",
        "dropped and yelled for the men behind me to drop, but they were too slow, taken by surprise like that.\n",
        "\"Most of them fell at the first volley that raked us from both sides. Some of the arrows crossed the trail\n",
        "and struck Picts on the other side. I heard them howl.\" He grinned with vicious satisfaction. \"Such of us\n",
        "as were left plunged into the woods and closed with them. When I saw the others were all down or taken,\n",
        "I broke through and outfooted the painted devils through the darkness. They were all around me. I ran\n",
        "and crawled and sneaked, and sometimes I lay on my belly under the bushes while they passed me on all\n",
        "sides.\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "360\n",
        "\"I tried for the shore and found it lined with them, waiting for just such a move. But I'd have cut my way\n",
        "through and taken a chance on swimming, only I heard the drums pounding in the village and knew\n",
        "they'd taken somebody alive.\n",
        "\"They were all so engrossed in Zogar's magic that I was able to climb the wall behind the altar-hut. There\n",
        "was a warrior supposed to be watching at that point, but he was squatting behind the hut and peering\n",
        "around the corner at the ceremony. I came up behind him and broke his neck with my hands before he\n",
        "knew what was happening. It was his spear I threw into the snake, and that's his ax you're carrying.\"\n",
        "\"But what was that--that thing you killed in the altar-hut?\" asked Balthus, with a shiver at the memory of\n",
        "the dim-seen horror.\n",
        "\"One of Zogar's gods. One of Jhebbal's children that didn't remember and had to be kept chained to the\n",

        "of Gullah.\n",
        "\"It's getting light. Here's a good place to hide until we see how close they're on our trail. Probably have to\n",
        "wait until night to break back to the river.\"\n",
        "A low hill pitched upward, girdled and covered with thick trees and bushes. Near the crest Conan slid\n",
        "into a tangle of jutting rocks, crowned by dense bushes. Lying among them they could see the jungle\n",
        "below without being seen. It was a good place to hide or defend. Balthus did not believe that even a Pict\n",
        "could have trailed them over the rocky ground for the past four or five miles, but he was afraid of the\n",

        "dismissed the possibility of beasts tracking them.\n",
        "A ghostly whiteness spread through the dense branches; the patches of sky visible altered in hue, grew\n",
        "from pink to blue. Balthus felt the gnawing of hunger, though he had slaked his thirst at a stream they\n",
        "had skirted. There was complete silence, except for an occasional chirp of a bird. The drums were no\n",
        "longer to be heard. Balthus' thoughts reverted to the grim scene before the altar-hut.\n",
        "\"Those were ostrich plumes Zogar Sag wore,\" he said. \"I've seen them on the helmets of knights who rode\n",
        "from the East to visit the barons of the marches. There are no ostriches in this forest, are there?\"\n",
        "\"They came from Kush,\" answered Conan. \"West of here, many marches, lies the seashore. Ships from\n",
        "Zingara occasionally come and trade weapons and ornaments and wine to the coastal tribes for skins and\n",
        "copper ore and gold dust. Sometimes they trade ostrich plumes they got from the Stygians, who in turn\n",
        "got them from the black tribes of Kush, which lies south of Stygia. The Pictish shamans place great store\n",
        "by them. But there's much risk in such trade. The Picts are too likely to try to seize the ship. And the coast\n",
        "is dangerous to ships. I've sailed along it when I was with the pirates of the Barachan Isles, which lie\n",
        "southwest of Zingara.\"\n",
        "Balthus looked at his companion with admiration.\n",
        "\"I knew you hadn't spent your life on this frontier. You've mentioned several far places. You've traveled\n",
        "widely?\"\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "361\n",
        "\"I've roamed far; farther than any other man of my race ever wandered. I've seen all the great cities of the\n",
        "Hyborians, the Shemites, the Stygians, and the Hyrkanians. I've roamed in the unknown countries south\n",
        "of the black kingdoms of Kush, and east of the Sea of Vilayet. I've been a mercenary captain, a corsair, a\n",
        "kozak, a penniless vagabond, a general--hell, I've been everything except a king of a civilized country,\n",
        "and I may be that, before I die.\" The fancy pleased him, and he grinned hardly. Then he shrugged his\n",
        "shoulders and stretched his mighty figure on the rocks. \"This is as good a life as any. I don't know how\n",
        "long I'll stay on the frontier; a week, a month, a year. I have a roving foot. But it's as well on the border as\n",
        "anywhere.\"\n",
        "Balthus set himself to watch the forest below them. Momentarily he expected to see fierce painted faces\n",
        "thrust through the leaves. But as the hours passed no stealthy footfall disturbed the brooding quiet.\n",
        "Balthus believed the Picts had missed their trail and given up the chase. Conan grew restless.\n",
        "\"We should have sighted parties scouring the woods for us. If they've quit the chase, it's because they're\n",
        "after bigger game. They may be gathering to cross the river and storm the fort.\"\n",
        "\"Would they come this far south if they lost the trail?\"\n",
        "\"They've lost the trail, all right; otherwise they'd have been on our necks before now. Under ordinary\n",
        "circumstances they'd scour the woods for miles in every direction. Some of them should have passed\n",
        "without sight of this hill. They must be preparing to cross the river. We've got to take a chance and make\n",
        "for the river.\"\n",
        "Creeping down the rocks Balthus felt his flesh crawl between his shoulders as he momentarily expected a\n",
        "withering blast of arrows from the green masses above them. He feared that the Picts had discovered\n",
        "them and were lying about in ambush. But Conan was convinced no enemies were near, and the\n",
        "Cimmerian was right.\n",
        "\"We're miles to the south of the village,\" grunted Conan. \"We'll hit straight through for the river. I don't\n",
        "know how far down the river they've spread, We'll hope to hit it below them.\"\n",
        "With haste that seemed reckless to Balthus they hurried eastward. The woods seemed empty of life.\n",
        "Conan believed that all the Picts were gathered in the vicinity of Gwawela, if, indeed, they had not\n",
        "already crossed the river. He did not believe they would cross in the daytime, however.\n",
        "\"Some woodsman would be sure to see them and give the alarm. They'll cross above and below the fort,\n",
        "out of sight of the sentries. Then others will get in canoes and make straight across for the river wall. As\n",
        "soon as they attack, those hidden in the woods on the east shore will assail the fort from the other sides.\n",
        "They've tried that before, and got the guts shot and hacked out of them. But this time they've got enough\n",
        "men to make a real onslaught of it.\"\n",
        "They pushed on without pausing, though Balthus gazed longingly at the squirrels flitting among the\n",
        "branches, which he could have brought down with a cast of his ax. With a sigh he drew up his broad belt.\n",
        "The everlasting silence and gloom of the primitive forest was beginning to depress him. He found himself\n",
        "thinking of the open groves and sun-dappled meadows of the Tauran, of the bluff cheer of his father's\n",
        "steep-thatched, diamond-paned house, of the fat cows browsing through the deep lush grass, and the\n",
        "hearty fellowship of the brawny, bare-armed plowmen and herdsmen.\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "362\n",
        "He felt lonely, in spite of his companion. Conan was as much a part of this wilderness as Balthus was\n",
        "alien to it. The Cimmerian might have spent years among the great cities of the world; he might have\n",
        "walked with the rulers of civilization; he might even achieve his wild whim some day and rule as king of\n",
        "a civilized nation; stranger things had happened. But he was no less a barbarian. He was concerned only\n",
        "with the naked fundamentals of life. The warm intimacies of small, kindly things, the sentiments and\n",
        "delicious trivialities that make up so much of civilized men's lives were meaningless to him. A wolf was\n",
        "no less a wolf because a whim of chance caused him to run with the watch-dogs. Bloodshed and violence\n",
        "and savagery were the natural elements of the life Conan knew; he could not, and would never,\n",
        "understand the little things that are so dear to civilized men and women.\n",
        "The shadows were lengthening when they reached the river and peered through the masking bushes.\n",
        "They could see up and down the river for about a mile each way. The sullen stream lay bare and empty.\n",
        "Conan scowled across at the other shore.\n",
        "\"We've got to take another chance here. We've got to swim the river. We don't know whether they've\n",
        "crossed or not. The woods over there may be alive with them. We've got to risk it. We're about six miles\n",
        "south of Gwawela.\"\n",
        "He wheeled and ducked as a bowstring twanged. Something like a white flash of light streaked through\n",
        "the bushes. Balthus knew it was an arrow. Then with a tigerish bound Conan was through the bushes.\n",
        "Balthus caught the gleam of steel as he whirled his sword, and heard a death scream. The next instant he\n",
        "had broken through the bushes after the Cimmerian.\n",
        "A Pict with a shattered skull lay face-down on the ground, his fingers spasmodically clawing at the grass.\n",
        "Half a dozen others were swarming about Conan, swords and axes lifted. They had cast away their bows,\n",
        "useless at such deadly close quarters. Their lower jaws were painted white, contrasting vividly with their\n",
        "dark faces, and the designs on their muscular breasts differed from any Balthus had ever seen.\n",
        "One of them hurled his ax at Balthus and rushed after it with lifted knife. Balthus ducked and then caught\n",
        "the wrist that drove the knife licking at his throat. They went to the ground together, rolling over and\n",
        "over. The Pict was like a wild beast, his muscles hard as steel strings.\n",
        "Balthus was striving to maintain his hold on the wild man's wrist and bring his own ax into play, but so\n",
        "fast and furious was the struggle that each attempt to strike was blocked. The Pict was wrenching\n",
        "furiously to free his knife hand, was clutching at Balthus' ax, and driving his knees at the youth's groin.\n",
        "Suddenly he attempted to shift his knife to his free hand, and in that instant Balthus, struggling up on one\n",
        "knee, split the painted head with a desperate blow of his ax.\n",
        "He sprang up and glared wildly about for his companion, expecting to see him overwhelmed by numbers.\n",
        "Then he realized the full strength and ferocity of the Cimmerian. Conan bestrode two of his attackers,\n",
        "shorn half asunder by that terrible broadsword. As Balthus looked he saw the Cimmerian beat down a\n",
        "thrusting shortsword, avoid the stroke of an ax with a cat-like side-wise spring which brought him within\n",
        "arm's length of a squat savage stooping for a bow. Before the Pict could straighten, the red sword flailed\n",
        "down and clove him from shoulder to midbreastbone, where the blade stuck. The remaining warriors\n",
        "rushed in, one from either side. Balthus hurled his ax with an accuracy that reduced the attackers to one,\n",
        "and Conan, abandoning his efforts to free his sword, wheeled and met the remaining Pict with his bare\n",
        "hands. The stocky warrior, a head shorter than his tall enemy, leaped in, striking with his ax, at the same \n",

        "time stabbing murderously with his knife. The knife broke on the Cimmerian's mail, and the ax checked\n",
        "in midair as Conan's fingers locked like iron on the descending arm. A bone snapped loudly, and Balthus\n",
        "saw the Pict wince and falter. The next instant he was swept off his feet, lifted high above the\n",
        "Cimmerian's head--he writhed in midair for an instant, kicking and thrashing, and then was dashed\n",
        "headlong to the earth with such force that he rebounded, and then lay still, his limp posture telling of\n",
        "splintered limbs and a broken spine.\n",
        "\"Come on!\" Conan wrenched his sword free and snatched up an ax. \"Grab a bow and a handful of arrows,\n",
        "and hurry! We've got to trust to our heels again. That yell was heard. They'll be here in no time. If we\n",

        "Conan did not plunge deeply into the forest. A few hundred yards from the river, he altered his slanting\n",
        "course and ran parallel with it. Balthus recognized a grim determination not to be hunted away from the\n",
        "river which they must cross if they were to warn the men in the fort. Behind them rose more loudly the\n",
        "yells of the forest men. Balthus believed the Picts had reached the glade where the bodies of the slain men\n",
        "lay. Then further yells seemed to indicate that the savages were streaming into the woods in pursuit.\n",
        "They had left a trail any Pict could follow.\n",
        "Conan increased his speed, and Balthus grimly set his teeth and kept on his heels, though he felt he might\n",
        "collapse any time. It seemed centuries since he had eaten last. He kept going more by an effort of will\n",
        "than anything else. His blood was pounding so furiously in his ear-drums that he was not aware when\n",
        "the yells died out behind them.\n",
        "Conan halted suddenly.. Balthus leaned against a tree and panted.\n",
        "\"They've quit!\" grunted the Cimmerian, scowling.\n",
        "\"Sneaking--up--on--us!\" gasped Balthus.\n",
        "Conan shook his head.\n",
        "\"A short chase like this they'd yell every step of the way. No. They've gone back. I thought I heard\n",
        "somebody yelling behind them a few seconds before the noise began to get dimmer. They've been\n",
        "recalled. And that's good for us, but damned bad for the men in the fort. It means the warriors are being\n",
        "summoned out of the woods for the attack. Those men we ran into were warriors from a tribe down the\n",
        "river. They were undoubtedly headed for Gwawela to join in the assault on the fort. Damn it, we're\n",
        "farther away than ever, now. We've got to get across the river.\"\n",
        "Turning east he hurried through the thickets with no attempt at concealment. Balthus followed him, for\n",
        "the first time feeling the sting of lacerations on his breast and shoulder where the Pict's savage teeth had\n",
        "scored him. He was pushing through the thick bushes that hinged the bank when Conan pulled him back. \n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "364\n",
        "Then he heard a rhythmic splashing, and peering through the leaves, saw a dugout canoe coming up the\n",
        "river, its single occupant paddling hard against the current. He was a strongly built Pict with a white\n",
        "heron feather thrust in a copper band that confined his square-cut mane.\n",
        "\"That's a Gwawela man,\" muttered Conan. \"Emissary from Zogar. White plume shows that. He's carried a\n",
        "peace talk to the tribes down the river and now he's trying to get back and take a hand in the slaughter.\"\n",
        "The lone ambassador was now almost even with their hiding-place, and suddenly Balthus almost jumped\n",
        "out of his skin. At his very ear had sounded the harsh gutturals of a Pict. Then he realized that Conan had\n",
        "called to the paddler in his own tongue. The man started, scanned the bushes and called back something,\n",
        "then cast a startled glance across the river, bent low and sent the canoe shooting in toward the western\n",
        "bank. Not understanding, Balthus saw Conan take from his hand the bow he had picked up in the glade,\n",
        "and notch an arrow.\n",
        "The Pict had run his canoe in close to the shore, and staring up into the bushes, called out something. His\n",
        "answer came in the twang of the bow-string, the streaking flight of the arrow that sank to the feathers in\n",
        "his broad breast. With a choking gasp he slumped sidewise and rolled into the shallow water. In an\n",
        "instant Conan was down the bank and wading into the water to grasp the drifting canoe. Balthus\n",
        "stumbled after him and somewhat dazedly crawled into the canoe. Conan scrambled in, seized the\n",
        "paddle and sent the craft shooting toward the eastern shore. Balthus noted with envious admiration the\n",
        "play of the great muscles beneath the sun-burnt skin. The Cimmerian seemed an iron man, who never\n",
        "knew fatigue.\n",
        "\"What did you say to the Pict?\" asked Balthus.\n",
        "\"Told him to pull into shore; said there was a white forest runner on the bank who was trying to get a\n",
        "shot at him.\"\n",
        "\"That doesn't seem fair,\" Balthus objected. \"He thought a friend was speaking to him. You mimicked a\n",
        "Pict perfectly--\"\n",
        "\"We needed his boat,\" grunted Conan, not pausing in his exertions. \"Only way to lure him to the bank.\n",
        "Which is worse--to betray a Pict who'd enjoy skinning us both alive, or betray the men across the river\n",
        "whose lives depend on our getting over?\"\n",
        "Balthus mulled over this delicate ethical question for a moment, then shrugged his shoulders and asked:\n",
        "\"How far are we from the fort?\"\n",
        "Conan pointed to a creek which flowed into Black River from the east, a few hundred yards below them.\n",
        "\"That's South Creek; it's ten miles from its mouth to the fort. It's the southern boundary of Conajohara.\n",
        "Marshes miles wide south of it. No danger of a raid from across them. Nine miles above the fort North\n",
        "Creek forms the other boundary. Marshes beyond that, too. That's why an attack must come from the\n",
        "west, across Black River. Conajohara's just like a spear, with a point nineteen miles wide, thrust into the\n",
        "Pictish wilderness.\"\n",
        "\"Why don't we keep to the canoe and make the trip by water?\"\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "365\n",
        "\"Because, considering the current we've got to brace, and the bends in the river, we can go faster afoot.\n",
        "Besides, remember Gwawela is south of the fort; if the Picts are crossing the river we'd run right into\n",
        "them.\"\n",
        "Dusk was gathering as they stepped upon the eastern bank. Without pause Conan pushed on northward,\n",
        "at a pace that made Balthus' sturdy legs ache.\n",
        "\"Valannus wanted a fort built at the mouths of North and South Creeks,\" grunted the Cimmerian. \"Then\n",
        "the river could be patrolled constantly. But the government wouldn't do it.\n",
        "\"Soft-bellied fools sitting on velvet cushions with naked girls offering them iced wine on their knees.--I\n",
        "know the breed. They can't see any farther than their palace wall. Diplomacy--hell! They'd fight Picts with\n",
        "theories of territorial expansion. Valannus and men like him have to obey the orders of a set of damned\n",
        "fools. They'll never grab any more Pictish land, any more than they'll ever rebuild Venarium. The time\n",
        "may come when they'll see the barbarians swarming over the walls of the eastern cities!\"\n",
        "A week before, Balthus would have laughed at any such preposterous suggestion. Now he made no reply.\n",
        "He had seen the unconquerable ferocity of the men who dwelt beyond the frontiers.\n",
        "He shivered, casting glances at the sullen river, just visible through the bushes, at the arches of the trees\n",
        "which crowded close to its banks. He kept remembering that the Picts might have crossed the river and\n",
        "be lying in ambush between them and the fort. It was fast growing dark.\n",
        "A slight sound ahead of them jumped his heart into his throat, and Conan's sword gleamed in the air. He\n",
        "lowered it when a dog, a great, gaunt, scarred beast, slunk out of the bushes and stood staring at them.\n",
        "\"That dog belonged to a settler who tried to build his cabin on the bank of the river a few miles south of\n",
        "the fort,\" grunted Conan. \"The Picts slipped over and killed him, of course, and burned his cabin. We\n",
        "found him dead among the embers, and the dog lying senseless among three Picts he'd killed. He was\n",
        "almost cut to pieces. We took him to the fort and dressed his wounds, but after he recovered he took to\n",
        "the woods and turned wild.--What now, Slasher, are you hunting the men who killed your master?\"\n",
        "The massive head swung from side to side and the eyes glowed greenly. He did not growl or bark.\n",
        "Silently as a phantom he slid in behind them.\n",
        "\"Let him come,\" muttered Conan. \"He can smell the devils before we can see them.\"\n",
        "Balthus smiled and laid his hand caressingly on the dog's head. The lips involuntarily writhed back to\n",
        "display the gleaming fangs; then the great beast bent his head sheepishly, and his tall moved with jerky\n",
        "uncertainty, as if the owner had almost forgotten the emotions of friendliness. Balthus mentally\n",
        "compared the great gaunt hard body with the fat sleek hounds tumbling vociferously over one another in\n",
        "his father's kennel yard. He sighed. The frontier was no less hard for beasts than for men. This dog had\n",
        "almost forgotten the meaning of kindness and friendliness.\n",
        "Slasher glided ahead, and Conan let him take the lead. The last tinge of dusk faded into stark darkness.\n",
        "The miles fell away under their steady feet. Slasher seemed voiceless. Suddenly he halted, tense, ears\n",
        "lifted. An instant later the men heard it--a demoniac yelling up the river ahead of them, faint as a whisper.\n",
        "Conan swore like a madman.\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "366\n",
        "\"They've attacked the fort! We're too late! Come on!\"\n",
        "He increased his pace, trusting to the dog to smell out ambushes ahead. In a flood of tense excitement,\n",
        "Balthus forgot his hunger and weariness. The yells grew louder as they advanced, and above the devilish\n",
        "screaming they could hear the deep shouts of the soldiers. Just as Balthus began to fear they would run\n",
        "into the savages who seemed to be howling just ahead of them, Conan swung away from the river in a\n",
        "wide semicircle that carried them to a low rise from which they could look over the forest. They saw the\n",
        "fort, lighted with torches thrust over the parapets on long poles. These cast a flickering, uncertain light\n",
        "over the clearing, and in that light they saw throngs of naked, painted figures along the fringe of the\n",
        "clearing. The river swarmed with canoes. The Picts had the fort completely surrounded.\n",
        "An incessant hail of arrows rained against the stockade from the woods and the river. The deep twanging\n",
        "of the bowstrings rose above the howling. Yelling like wolves, several hundred naked warriors with axes\n",
        "in their hands ran from under the trees and raced toward the eastern gate. They were within a hundred\n",
        "and fifty yards of their objective when a withering blast of arrows from the wall littered the ground with\n",
        "corpses and sent the survivors fleeing back to the trees. The men in the canoes rushed their boats toward\n",
        "the river-wall, and were met by another shower of clothyard shafts and a volley from the small ballistae\n",
        "mounted on towers on that side of the stockade. Stones and logs whirled through the air and splintered\n",
        "and sank half a dozen canoes, killing their occupants, and the other boats drew back out of range. A deep\n",
        "roar of triumph rose from the walls of the fort, answered by bestial howling from all quarters.\n",
        "\"Shall we try to break through?\" asked Balthus, trembling with eagerness.\n",
        "Conan shook his head. He stood with his arms folded, his head slightly bent, a somber and brooding\n",
        "figure.\n",
        "\"The fort's doomed. The Picts are blood-mad, and won't stop until they're all killed. And there are too\n",
        "many of them for the men in the fort to kill. We couldn't break through, and if we did, we could do\n",
        "nothing but die with Valannus.\"\n",
        "\"There's nothing we can do but save our own hides, then?\"\n",
        "\"Yes. We've got to warn the settlers. Do you know why the Picts are not trying to burn the fort with firearrows? Because they don't want a flame that might warn the people to the east. They plan to stamp out\n",
        "the fort, and then sweep east before anyone knows of its fall. They may cross Thunder River and take\n",
        "Velitrium before the people know what's happened. At least they'll destroy every living thing between\n",
        "the fort and Thunder River.\n",
        "\"We've failed to warn the fort, and I see now it would have done no good if we had succeeded. The fort's\n",
        "too poorly manned. A few more charges and the Picts will be over the walls and breaking down the gates.\n",
        "But we can start the settlers toward Velitrium. Come on! We're outside the circle the Picts have thrown\n",
        "around the fort. We'll keep clear of it.\"\n",
        "They swung out in a wide arc, hearing the rising and falling of the volume of the yells, marking each\n",
        "charge and repulse. The men in the fort were holding their own; but the shrieks of the Picts did not\n",

        "\"Now run!\" grunted Conan. Balthus set his teeth. It was nineteen miles to Velitrium, a good five to Scalp\n",
        "Creek beyond which began the settlements. It seemed to the Aquilonian that they had been fighting and\n",
        "running for centuries. But the nervous excitement that rioted through his blood stimulated him to\n",
        "herculean efforts.\n",
        "Slasher ran ahead of them, his head to the ground, snarling low, the first sound they had heard from him.\n",
        "\"Picts ahead of us!\" snarled Conan, dropping to one knee and scanning the ground in the starlight. He\n",
        "shook his head, baffled. \"I can't tell how many. Probably only a small party. Some that couldn't wait to\n",

        "Ahead of them presently they saw a small blaze through the trees, and, heard a wild and ferocious\n",
        "chanting. The trail bent there, and leaving it, they cut across the bend, through the thickets. A few\n",
        "moments later they were looking on a hideous sight. An ox-wain stood in the road piled with meager\n",
        "household furnishings; it was burning; the oxen lay near with their throats cut. A man and a woman lay\n",
        "in the road, stripped and mutilated. Five Picts were dancing about them with fantastic leaps and bounds,\n",
        "waving bloody axes; one of them brandished the woman's red-smeared gown.\n",
        "At the sight a red haze swam before Balthus. Lifting his bow he lined the prancing figure, black against\n",
        "the fire, and loosed. The slayer leaped convulsively and fell dead with the arrow through his heart. Then\n",
        "the two white men and the dog were upon the startled survivors. Conan was animated merely by his\n",
        "fighting spirit and an old, old racial hate, but Balthus was afire with wrath.\n",
        "He met the first Pict to oppose him with a ferocious swipe that split the painted skull, and sprang over his\n",
        "failing body to grapple with the others. But Conan had already killed one of the two he had chosen, and\n",
        "the leap of the Aquilonian was a second late. The warrior was down with the long sword through him\n",
        "even as Balthus' ax was lifted. Turning toward the remaining Pict, Balthus saw Slasher rise from his\n",
        "victim, his great jaws dripping blood.\n",
        "Balthus said nothing as he looked down at the pitiful forms in the road beside the burning wain. Both\n",
        "were young, the woman little more than a girl. By some whim of chance the Picts had left her face\n",
        "unmarred, and even in the agonies of an awful death it was beautiful. But her soft young body had been\n",
        "hideously slashed with many knives--a mist clouded Balthus' eyes and he swallowed chokingly. The\n",
        "tragedy momentarily overcame him. He felt like falling upon the ground and weeping and biting the\n",
        "earth.\n",
        "\"Some young couple just hitting out on their own,\" Conan was saying as he wiped his sword\n",
        "unemotionally. \"On their way to the fort when the Picts met them. Maybe the boy was going to enter the\n",
        "service; maybe take up land on the river. Well, that's what will happen to every man, woman, and child\n",
        "this side of Thunder River if we don't get them into Velitrium in a hurry.\"\n",
        "Balthus' knees trembled as he followed Conan. But there was no hint of weakness in the long easy stride\n",
        "of the Cimmerian. There was a kinship between him and the great gaunt brute that glided beside him.\n",
        "Slasher no longer growled with his head to the trail. The way was clear before them. The yelling on the\n",
        "river came faintly to them, but Balthus believed the fort was still holding. Conan halted suddenly, with\n",
        "an oath.\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "368\n",
        "He showed Balthus a trail that led north from the road. It was an old trail, partly grown with new young\n",
        "growth, and this growth had recently been broken down. Balthus realized this fact more by feel than\n",
        "sight, though Conan seemed to see like a cat in the dark. The Cimmerian showed him where broad\n",
        "wagon tracks turned off the main trail, deeply indented in the forest mold.\n",
        "\"Settlers going to the licks after salt,\" he grunted. \"They're at the edges of the marsh, about nine miles\n",
        "from here. Blast it! They'll be cut off and butchered to a man! Listen! One man can warn the people on the\n",
        "road. Go ahead and wake them up and herd them into Velitrium. I'll go and get the men gathering the\n",
        "salt. They'll be camped by the licks. We won't come back to the road. We'll head straight through the\n",
        "woods.\"\n",
        "With no further comment Conan turned off the trail and hurried down the dim path, and Balthus, after\n",
        "staring after him for a few moments, set out along the road. The dog had remained with him, and glided\n",
        "softly at his heels. When Balthus had gone a few rods he heard the animal growl. Whirling, he glared\n",
        "back the way he had come, and was startled to see a vague ghostly glow vanishing into the forest in the\n",
        "direction Conan had taken. Slasher rumbled deep in his throat, his hackles stiff and his eyes balls of green\n",
        "fire. Balthus remembered the grim apparition that had taken the head of the merchant Tiberias not far\n",
        "from that spot, and he hesitated. The thing must be following Conan. But the giant Cimmerian had\n",
        "repeatedly demonstrated his ability to take care of himself, and Balthus felt his duty lay toward the\n",
        "helpless settlers who slumbered in the path of the red hurricane. The horror of the fiery phantom was\n",
        "overshadowed by the horror of those limp, violated bodies beside the burning ox-wain.\n",
        "He hurried down the road, crossed Scalp Creek and came in sight of the first settler's cabin--a, long, low\n",
        "structure of ax-hewn logs. In an instant he was pounding on the door. A sleepy voice inquired his\n",
        "pleasure.\n",
        "\"Get up! The Picts are over the river!\"\n",
        "That brought instant response. A low cry echoed his words and then the door was thrown open by a\n",
        "woman in a scanty shift. Her hair hung over her bare shoulders in disorder; she held a candle in one hand\n",
        "and an ax in the other. Her face was colorless, her eyes wide with terror.\n",
        "\"Come in!\" she begged. \"We'll hold the cabin.\"\n",
        "\"No. We must make for Velitrium. The fort can't hold them back. It may have fallen already. Don't stop to\n",
        "dress. Get your children and come on.\"\n",
        "\"But my man's gone with the others after salt!\" she wailed, wringing her hands. Behind her peered three\n",
        "tousled youngsters, blinking and bewildered.\n",
        "\"Conan's gone after them. He'll fetch them through safe. We must hurry up the road to warn the other\n",

        "Relief flooded her countenance.\n",
        "\"Mitra be thanked!\" she cried. \"If the Cimmerian's gone after them, they're safe if mortal man can save\n",
        "them!\"\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "369\n",
        "In a whirlwind of activity she snatched up the smallest child and herded the others through the door\n",
        "ahead of her. Balthus took the candle and ground it out under his heel. He listened an instant. No sound\n",
        "came up the dark road.\n",
        "\"Have you got a horse?\"\n",
        "\"In the stable,\" she groaned. \"Oh, hurry!\"\n",
        "He pushed her aside as she fumbled with shaking hands at the bars. He led the horse out and lifted the\n",
        "children on its back, telling them to hold to its mane and to one another. They stared at him seriously,\n",
        "making no outcry. The woman took the horse's halter and set out up the road. She still gripped her ax\n",
        "and Balthus knew that if cornered she would fight with the desperate courage of a she-panther.\n",
        "He held behind, listening. He was oppressed by the belief that the fort had been stormed and taken, that\n",
        "the dark-skinned hordes were already streaming up the road toward Velitrium, drunken on slaughter\n",
        "and mad for blood. They would come with the speed of starving wolves.\n",
        "Presently they saw another cabin looming ahead. The woman started to shriek a warning, but Balthus\n",
        "stopped her. He hurried to the door and knocked. A woman's voice answered him. He repeated his\n",
        "warning, and soon the cabin disgorged its occupants--an old woman, two young women, and four\n",
        "children. Like the other woman's husband, their men had gone to the salt licks the day before,\n",
        "unsuspecting of any danger. One of the young women seemed dazed, the other prone to hysteria. But the\n",
        "old woman, a stern old veteran of the frontier, quieted them harshly; she helped Balthus get out the two\n",
        "horses that were stabled in a pen behind the cabin and put the children on them. Balthus urged that she\n",
        "herself mount with them, but she shook her head and made one of the younger women ride.\n",
        "\"She's with child,\" grunted the old woman. \"I can walk--and fight, too, if it comes to that.\"\n",
        "As they set out, one of the young women said: \"A young couple passed along the road about dusk; we\n",
        "advised them to spend the night at our cabin, but they were anxious to make the fort tonight. Did--did--\"\n",
        "\"They met the Picts,\" answered Balthus briefly, and the woman sobbed in horror.\n",
        "They were scarcely out of sight of the cabin when some distance behind them quavered a long highpitched yell.\n",
        "\"A wolf!\" exclaimed one of the women.\n",
        "\"A painted wolf with an ax in his hand,\" muttered Balthus. \"Go! Rouse the other settlers along the road\n",
        "and take them with you. I'll scout along behind.\"\n",
        "Without a word the old woman herded her charges ahead of her. As they faded into the darkness,\n",
        "Balthus could see the pale ovals that were the faces of the children twisted back over their shoulders to\n",
        "stare toward him. He remembered his own people on the Tauran and a moment's giddy sickness swam\n",
        "over him. With momentary weakness he groaned and sank down in the road, his muscular arm fell over\n",
        "Slasher's massive neck and he felt the dog's warm moist tongue touch his face.\n",
        "He lifted his head and grinned with a painful effort.\n",
        "Beyond the Black River\n",
        "370\n",
        "\"Come on, boy,\" he mumbled, rising. \"We've got work to do.\"\n",
        "A red glow suddenly became evident through the trees. The Picts had fired the last hut. He grinned. How\n",
        "Zogar Sag would froth if he knew his warriors had let their destructive natures get the better of them. The\n",
        "fire would warn the people farther up the road. They would be awake and alert when the fugitives\n",
        "reached them. But his face grew grim. The women were traveling slowly, on foot and on the overloaded\n",
        "horses. The swift-footed Picts would run them down within a mile, unless--he took his position behind a\n",
        "tangle of fallen logs beside the trail. The road west of him was lighted by the burning cabin, and when the\n",
        "Picts came he saw them first--black furtive figures etched against the distant glare.\n",
        "Drawing a shaft to the head, he loosed and one of the figures crumpled. The rest melted into the woods\n",
        "on either side of the road. Slasher whimpered with the killing lust beside him. Suddenly a figure\n",
        "appeared on the fringe of the trail, under the trees, and began gliding toward the fallen timbers. Balthus'\n",
        "bow-string twanged and the Pict yelped, staggered and fell into the shadows with the arrow through his\n",
        "thigh. Slasher cleared the timbers with a bound and leaped into the bushes. They were violently shaken\n",
        "and then the dog slunk back to Balthus' side, his jaws crimson.\n",
        "No more appeared in the trail; Balthus began to fear they were stealing past his position through the\n",
        "woods, and when he heard a faint sound to his left he loosed blindly. He cursed as he heard the shaft\n",
        "splinter against a tree, but Slasher glided away as silently as a phantom, and presently Balthus heard a\n",
        "thrashing and a gurgling; then Slasher came like a ghost through the bushes, snuggling his great,\n",
        "crimson-stained head against Balthus' arm. Blood oozed from a gash in his shoulder, but the sounds in\n",
        "the wood had ceased for ever.\n",
        "The men lurking on the edges of the road evidently sensed the fate of their companion, and decided that\n",
        "an open charge was preferable to being dragged down in the dark by a devil-beast they could neither see\n",
        "nor hear. Perhaps they realized that only one man lay behind the logs. They came with a sudden rush,\n",
        "breaking cover from both sides of the trail. Three dropped with arrows through them--and the remaining\n",
        "pair hesitated. One turned and ran back down the road, but the other lunged over the breastwork, his\n",
        "eyes and teeth gleaming in the dim light, his ax lifted. Balthus' foot slipped as he sprang up, but the slip\n",
        "saved his life. The descending ax shaved a lock of hair from his head, and the Pict rolled down the logs\n",
        "from the force of his wasted blow. Before he could regain his feet Slasher tore his throat out.\n",
        "Then followed a tense period of waiting, in which time Balthus wondered if the man who had fled had\n",
        "been the only survivor of the party. Obviously it had been a small band that had either left the fighting at\n",
        "the fort, or was scouting ahead of the main body. Each moment that passed increased the chances for\n",
        "safety of the women and children hurrying toward Velithum.\n",
        "Then without warning a shower of arrows whistled over his retreat. A wild howling rose from the woods\n",
        "along the trail. Either the survivor had gone after aid, or another party had joined the first. The burning\n",
        "cabin still smoldered, lending a little light. Then they were after him, gliding through the trees beside the\n",
        "trail. He shot three arrows and threw the bow away. As if sensing his plight, they came on, not yelling\n",
        "now, but in deadly silence except for a swift pad of many feet.\n",
        "He fiercely hugged the head of the great dog growling at his side, muttered: \"All right, boy, give 'em\n",
        "hell!\" and sprang to his feet, drawing his ax. Then the dark figures flooded over the breastworks and\n",
        "closed in a storm of flailing axes, stabbing knives and ripping fangs.\n",

        "they were making in their progress he knew they were not Picts. He hailed them.\n",
        "\"Who's there?\" challenged a harsh voice. \"Stand where you are until we know you, or you'll get an arrow\n",
        "through you.\"\n",
        "\"You couldn't hit an elephant in this darkness,\" answered Conan impatiently. \"Come on, fool; it's I--\n",
        "Conan. The Picts are over the river.\"\n",
        "\"We suspected as much,\" answered the leader of the men, as they strode forward--tall, rangy men, sternfaced, with bows in their hands. \"One of our party wounded an antelope and tracked it nearly to Black\n",
        "River. He heard them yelling down the river and ran back to our camp. We left the salt and the wagons,\n",
        "turned the oxen loose, and came as swiftly as we could. If the Picts are besieging the fort, war-parties will\n",
        "be ranging up the road toward our cabins.\"\n",
        "\"Your families are safe,\" grunted Conan. \"My companion went ahead to take them to Velitrium. If we go\n",

        "ahead. I'll scout behind.\"\n",
        "A few moments later the whole band was hurrying southeastward. Conan followed more slowly,\n",

        "\"Conan! Conan! Wait for me, Conan!\"\n",
        "\"Balthus!\" he swore bewilderedly. Cautiously he called: \"Here I am!\"\n",
        "\"Wait for me, Conan!\" the voice came more distinctly.\n",
        "Conan moved out of the shadows, scowling. \"What the devil are you doing here?--Crom!\"\n",
        "He half crouched, the flesh prickling along his spine. It was not Balthus who was emerging from the other\n",

        "green witch-fire that moved with purpose and intent.\n",
        "It halted some feet away and Conan glared at it, trying to distinguish its fire-misted outlines. The\n",

        "entity; but the Cimmerian was unable to make out its shape or likeness. Then, shockingly, a voice spoke\n",

        "\"Why do you stand like a sheep waiting for the butcher, Conan?\"\n",
        "The voice was human but carried strange vibrations that were not human.\n",
        "\"Sheep?\" Conan's wrath got the best of his momentary awe. \"Do you think I'm afraid of a damned Pictish\n",

        "\"I called in his voice,\" answered the other. \"The men you follow belong to my brother; I would not rob his\n",

        "your doom in the forests of Conajohara.\"\n",
        "\"You've had your chance at me before now,\" snorted Conan. \"Why didn't you kill me then, if you could?\"\n",
        "\"My brother had not painted a skull black for you and hurled it into the fire that burns for ever on\n",

        "Something--a hand, foot or talon, he could not tell which, thrust out from the fire and marked swiftly on\n",
        "the mold. A symbol blazed there, marked with fire, and faded, but not before he recognized it.\n",
        "\"You dared make the sign which only a priest of Jhebbal Sag dare make. Thunder rumbled through the\n",

        "brother. Your body will be eaten by the black-winged, sharp-beaked Children of Jhil.\"\n",

        "\"Zogar Sag; a child of Jhebbal Sag who still visits his sacred groves at times. A woman of Gwawela slept\n",
        "in a grove holy to Jhebbal Sag. Her babe was Zogar Sag. I too am a son of Jhebbal Sag, out of a fire-being\n",
        "from a far realm. Zogar Sag summoned me out of the Misty Lands. With incantations and sorcery and his\n",

        "and there was a demoniac aspect about it--Conan had noted various abnormalities about Zogar Sag's\n",
        "features--an obliqueness of the eyes, a sharpness of the ears, a wolfish thinness of the lips: these\n",
        "peculiarities were exaggerated in the apparition which swayed before him. The eyes were red as coals of\n",

        "More details came into view: a slender torso, covered with snaky scales, which was yet man-like in shape,\n",
        "with man like arms, from the waist upward, below, long crane-like legs ended in splay, three-toed feet\n",
        "like those of huge bird. Along the monstrous limbs the blue fire fluttered and ran. He saw it as through a\n",

        "for the first time he noticed was armed with curving, sickle-like talons, swung high and swept down at\n",
        "his neck. With a fierce cry he broke the spell and bounded aside, hurling his ax. The demon avoided the\n",

        "decapitated him. But fierce joy surged through him as his savagely driven sword sank deep in the\n",
        "monster's groin. He bounded backward from a flailing stroke, tearing his sword free as he leaped. The\n",
        "talons raked his breast, ripping through mail-links as if they had been cloth. But his return spring was\n",

        "but the Stygian laughed, a ghastly laugh of inhuman cynicism and mockery. The others lowered their\n",

        "Conan followed Aram down a corridor lighted by copper lamps, and it did not please him to note his\n",
        "host's noiseless tread. Aram's feet were clad in soft slippers and the hallway was carpeted with thick\n",

        "At the end of the winding corridor, Aram halted at a door, across which a heavy iron bar rested in\n",
        "powerful metal brackets. This Aram lifted and showed the Cimmerian into a well-appointed chamber,\n",
        "the windows of which, Conan instantly noted, were small and strongly set with twisted bars of iron,\n",
        "tastefully gilded. There were rugs on the floor, a couch, after the Eastern fashion, and ornately carven\n",
        "stools. It was a much more elaborate chamber than Conan could have procured for the price nearer the\n",
        "center of the city--a fact that had first attracted him, when, that morning, he discoverd how slim a purse\n",
        "his roistering for the past few days had left him. He had ridden into Zamboula from the desert a week\n",
        "before.\n",

        "\"Your bolts and bars are strong; but I always sleep with steel by my side.\"\n",
        "Aram made no reply; he stood fingering his thick beard for a moment as he stared at the grim weapon.\n",
        "Then silently he withdrew, closing the door behind him. Conan shot the bolt into place, crossed the room,\n",
        "opened the opposite door, and looked out. The room was on the side of the house that faced the road\n",
        "running west from the city. The door opened into a small court that was enclosed by a wall of its own.\n",
        "The end walls, which shut it off from the rest of the tavern compound, were high and without entrances;\n",
        "but the wall that flanked the road was low, and there was no lock on the gate.\n",
        "Conan stood for a moment in the door, the glow of the bronze lamps behind him, looking down the road\n",
        "to where it vanished among the dense palms. Their leaves rustled together in the faint breeze; beyond \n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "380\n",
        "them lay the naked desert. Far up the street, in the other direction, lights gleamed and the noises of the\n",

        "wall, the dust of the road and the deserted huts thrusting their flat roofs against the low stars. Somewhere\n",
        "beyond the palm groves a drum began.\n",
        "The garbled warnings of the Zuagir returned to him, seeming somewhow less fantastic than they had\n",
        "seemed in the crowded, sunlit streets. He wondered again at the riddle of those empty huts. Why did the\n",
        "beggars shun them? He turned back into the chamber, shut the door, and bolted it.\n",
        "The light began to flicker, and he investigated, swearing when he found the palm oil in the lamp was\n",
        "almost exhausted. He started to shout for Aram, then shrugged his shoulders and blew out the light. In\n",
        "the soft darkness he stretched himself fully clad on the couch, his sinewy hand by instinct searching for\n",
        "and closing on the hilt of his broadsword. Glancing idly at the stars framed in the barred windows, with\n",
        "the murmur of the breeze though the palms in his ears, he sank into slumber with a vague consciousness\n",
        "of the muttering drum, out on the desert--the low rumble and mutter of a leather-covered drum, beaten\n",

        "do, drowsy and drugged and stupid. He awoke instantly, with a clear mind, recognizing the sound that\n",
        "had interruped his sleep. Lying there tensely in the dark he saw the outer door slowly open. In a\n",
        "widening crack of starlit sky he saw framed a great black bulk, broad, stooping shoulders, and a\n",
        "misshapen head blocked out against the stars.\n",
        "Conan felt the skin crawl between his shoulders. He had bolted that door securely. How could it be\n",
        "opening now, save by supernatural agency? And how could a human being possess a head like that\n",
        "outlined against the stars? All the tales he had heard in the Zuagir tents of devils and goblins came back\n",
        "to bead his flesh with clammy sweat. Now the monster slid noiselessly into the room, with a crouching\n",
        "posture and a shambling gait; and a familiar scent assailed the Cimmerian's nostrils, but did not reassure\n",
        "him, since Zuagir legendry represented demons as smelling like that.\n",
        "Noiselessly Conan coiled his long legs under him; his naked sword was in his right hand, and when he\n",
        "struck it was as suddenly and murderously as a tiger lunging out of the dark. Not even a demon could\n",

        "went heavily to the floor with a strangling cry. Conan crouched in the dark above it, sword dripping in\n",
        "his hand. Devil or beast or man, the thing was dead there on the floor. He sensed death as any wild thing\n",
        "senses it. He glared through the half-open door into the starlit court beyond. The gate stood open, but the\n",
        "court was empty.\n",
        "Conan shut the door but did not bolt it. Groping in the darkness he found the lamp and lighted it. There\n",
        "was enough oil in it to burn for a minute or so. An instant later he was bending over the figure that\n",
        "sprawled on the floor in a pool of blood.\n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "381\n",
        "It was a gigantic black man, naked but for a loin cloth. One hand still grasped a knotty-headed budgeon.\n",
        "The fellow's kinky wool was built up into hornlike spindles with twigs and dried mud. This barbaric\n",
        "coiffure had given the head its misshapen appearance in the starlight. Provided with a clue to the riddle,\n",
        "Conan pushed back the thick red lips and grunted as he stared down at teeth filed to points.\n",
        "He understood now the mystery of the strangers who had disappeared from the house of Aram Baksh;\n",
        "the riddle of the black drum thrumming out there beyond the palm groves, and of that pit of charred\n",
        "bones--that pit where strange meat might be roasted under the stars, while black beasts squatted about to\n",
        "glut a hideous hunger. The man on the floor was a cannibal slave from Darfar.\n",
        "There were many of his kind in the city. Cannibalism was not tolerated openly in Zamboula. But Conan\n",
        "knew now why people locked themselves in so securely at night, and why even beggars shunned the\n",
        "open alley and doorless ruins. He grunted in disgust as he visualized brutish black shadows skulking up\n",
        "and down the nighted streets, seeking human prey--and such men as Aram Baksh to open the doors to\n",
        "them. The innkeeper was not a demon; he was worse. The slaves from Darfar were notorious thieves;\n",
        "there was no doubt that some of their pilfered loot found its way into the hands of Aram Baksh. And in\n",
        "return he sold them human flesh.\n",
        "Conan blew out the light, stepped to the door and opened it, and ran his hand over the ornaments on the\n",
        "outer side. One of them was movable and worked the bolt inside. The room was a trap to catch human\n",
        "prey like rabbits. But this time, instead of a rabbit, it had caught a saber-toothed tiger.\n",
        "Conan returned to the other door, lifted the bolt, and pressed against it. It was immovable, and he\n",
        "remembered the bolt on the other side. Aram was taking no chances either with his victims or the men\n",
        "with whom he dealt. Buckling on his sword belt, the Cimmerian strode out into the court, closing the\n",
        "door behind him. He had no intention of delaying the settlement of his reckoning with Aram Baksh. He\n",
        "wondered how many poor devils had been bludgeoned in their sleep and dragged out of that room and\n",
        "down the road that ran through the shadowed palm groves to the roasting pit.\n",
        "He halted in the court. The drum was still muttering, and he caught the reflection of a leaping red glare\n",
        "through the groves. Cannibalism was more than a perverted appetite with the black men of Darfar; it was\n",
        "an integral element of their ghastly cult. The black vultures were already in conclave. But whatever flesh\n",
        "filled their bellies that night, it would not be his.\n",
        "To reach Aram Baksh, he must climb one of the walls which separated the small enclosure from the main\n",
        "compound. They were high, meant to keep out the man-eaters; but Conan was no swamp-bred black man;\n",
        "his thews had been steeled in boyhood on the sheer cliffs of his native hills. He was standing at the foot of\n",
        "the nearer wall when a cry echoed under the trees.\n",
        "In an instant Conan was crouching at the gate, glaring down the road. The sound had come from the\n",
        "shadows of the huts across the road. He heard a frantic choking and gurgling such as might result from a\n",
        "desperate attempt to shriek, with a black hand fastened over the victim's mouth. A close-knit clump of\n",
        "figures emerged from the shadows beyond the huts and started down the road--three huge black men\n",
        "carrying a slender, struggling figure between them. Conan caught the glimmer of pale limbs writhing in\n",
        "the starlight, even as, with a convulsive wrench, the captive slipped from the grasp of the brutal fingers\n",
        "and came flying up the road, a supple young woman, naked as the day she was born. Conan saw her\n",
        "plainly before she ran out of the road and into the shadows between the huts. The blacks were at her \n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "382\n",
        "heels, and back in the shadows the figures merged and an intolerable scream of anguish and horror rang\n",
        "out.\n",
        "Stirred to red rage by the ghoulishness of the episode, Conan raced across the road.\n",
        "Neither victim nor abductors were aware of his presence until the soft swish of the dust about his feet\n",
        "brought them about; and then he was almost upon them, coming with the gusty fury of a hill wind. Two\n",
        "of the blacks turned to meet him, lifting their bludgeons. But they failed to estimate properly the speed at\n",
        "which he was coming. One of them was down, disemboweled, before he could strike, and wheeling\n",
        "catlike, Conan evaded the stroke of the other's cudgel and lashed in a whistling counter-cut. The black's\n",
        "head flew into the air; the headless body took three staggering steps, spurting blood and clawing horribly\n",
        "at the air with groping hands, and then slumped to the dust.\n",
        "The remaining cannibal gave back with a strangled yell, hurling his captive from him. She tripped and\n",
        "rolled in the dust, and the black fled in panic toward the city. Conan was at his heels. Fear winged the\n",
        "black feet, but before they reached the easternmost hut, he sensed death at his back, and bellowed like an\n",
        "ox in the slaughter yards.\n",
        "\"Black dog of Hell!\" Conan drove his sword between the dusky shoulders with such vengeful fury that\n",
        "the broad blade stood out half its length from the black breast. With a choking cry the black stumbled\n",
        "headlong, and Conan braced his feet and dragged out his sword as his victim fell.\n",
        "Only the breeze disturbed the leaves. Conan shook his head as a lion shakes its mane and growled his\n",
        "unsatiated blood lust. But no more shapes slunk from the shadows, and before the huts the starlit road\n",
        "stretched empty. He whirled at the quick patter of feet behind him, but it was only the girl, rushing to\n",
        "throw herself on him and clasp his neck in a desperate grasp, frantic from terror of the abominable fate\n",
        "she had just escaped.\n",
        "\"Easy, girl,\" he grunted. \"You're all right. How did they catch you?\"\n",
        "She sobbed something unintelligible. He forgot all about Aram Baksh as he scrutinized her by the light of\n",
        "the stars. She was white, though a very definite brunette, obviously one of Zamboula's many mixed\n",
        "breeds. She was tall, with a slender, supple form, as he was in a good position to observe. Admiration\n",
        "burned in his fierce eyes as he looked down on her splendid bosom and her lithe limbs, which still\n",
        "quivered from fright and exertion. He passed an arm around her flexible waist and said, reassuringly:\n",
        "\"Stop shaking, wench; you're safe enough.\"\n",
        "His touch seemed to restore her shaken sanity. She tossed back her thick, glossy locks and cast a fearful\n",
        "glance over her shoulder, while she pressed closer to the Cimmerian as if seeking security in the contact.\n",
        "\"They caught me in the streets,\" she muttered, shuddering. \"Lying in wait, beneath a dark arch--black\n",
        "men, like great, hulking apes! Set have mercy on me! I shall dream of it!\"\n",
        "\"What were you doing out on the streets this time of night?\" he inquired, fascinated by the satiny feel of\n",
        "her sleek skin under his questing fingers.\n",
        "She raked back her hair and stared blankly up into his face. She did not seem aware of his caresses.\n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "383\n",
        "\"My lover,\" she said. \"My lover drove me into the streets. He went mad and tried to kill me. As I fled\n",
        "from him I was seized by those beasts.\"\n",
        "\"Beauty like yours might drive a man mad,\" quoth Conan, running his fingers experimentally through the\n",
        "glossy tresses.\n",
        "She shook her head, like one emerging from a daze. She no longer trembled, and her voice was steady.\n",
        "\"It was the spite of a priest--of Totrasmek, the high priest of Hanuman, who desires me for himself--the\n",
        "dog!\"\n",
        "\"No need to curse him for that,\" grinned Conan. \"The old hyena has better taste than I thought.\"\n",
        "She ignored the bluff compliment. She was regaining her poise swiftly.\n",
        "\"My lover is a--a young Turanian soldier. To spite me, Totrasmek gave him a drug that drove him mad.\n",
        "Tonight he snatched up a sword and came at me to slay me in his madness, but I fled from him into the\n",
        "streets. The Negroes seized me and brought me to this--what was that?\"\n",
        "Conan had already moved. Soundlessly as a shadow he drew her behind the nearest hut, beneath the\n",
        "straggling palms. They stood in tense stillness, while the low muttering both had heard grew louder until\n",
        "voices were distinguishable. A group of Negroes, some nine or ten, were coming along the road from the\n",
        "direction of the city. The girl clutched Conan's arm and he felt the terrified quivering of her supple body\n",
        "against his.\n",
        "Now they could understand the gutturals of the black men.\n",
        "\"Our brothers are already assembled at the pit,\" said one. \"We have had no luck. I hope they have enough\n",
        "for us.\"\n",
        "\"Aram promised us a man,\" muttered another, and Conan mentally promised Aram something.\n",
        "\"Aram keeps his word,\" grunted yet another. \"Many a man we have taken from his tavern. But we pay\n",
        "him well. I myself have given him ten bales of silk I stole from my master. It was good silk, by Set!\"\n",
        "The blacks shuffled past, bare splay feet scuffing up the dust, and their voices dwindled down the road.\n",
        "\"Well for us those corpses are lying behind these huts,\" muttered Conan. \"If they look in Aram's death\n",
        "room they'll find another. Let's begone.\"\n",
        "\"Yes, let us hasten!\" begged the girl, almost hysterical again. \"My lover is wandering somewhere in the\n",
        "streets alone. The Negroes may take him.\"\n",
        "\"A devil of a custom this is!\" growled Conan, as he led the way toward the city, paralleling the road but\n",
        "keeping behind the huts and straggling trees. \"Why don't the citizens clean out these black dogs?\"\n",
        "\"They are valuable slaves,\" murmured the girl. \"There are so many of them they might revolt if they were\n",
        "denied the flesh for which they lust. The people of Zamboula know they skulk the streets at night, and all\n",
        "are careful to remain within locked doors, except when something unforseen happens, as it did to me. \n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "384\n",
        "The blacks prey on anything they can catch, but they seldom catch anybody but strangers. The people of\n",
        "Zamboula are not concerned with the strangers that pass through the city.\n",
        "\"Such men as Aram Baksh sell these strangers to the blacks. He would not dare attempt such a thing with\n",
        "a citizen.\"\n",
        "Conan spat in disgust, and a moment later led his companion out into the road which was becoming a\n",
        "street, with still, unlighted houses on each side. Slinking in the shadows was not congenial to his nature.\n",
        "\"Where did you want to go?\" he asked. The girl did not seem to object to his arm around her waist.\n",
        "\"To my house, to rouse my servants,\" she answered. \"To bid them search for my lover. I do not wish the\n",
        "city--the priests--anyone--to know of his madness. He--he is a young officer with a promising future.\n",
        "Perhaps we can drive this madness from him if we can find him.\"\n",
        "\"If we find him?\" rumbled Conan. \"What makes you think I want to spend the night scouring the streets\n",
        "for a lunatic?\"\n",
        "She cast a quick glance into his face, and properly interpreted the gleam in his blue eyes. Any woman\n",
        "could have known that he would follow her wherever she led--for a while, at least. But being a women,\n",
        "she concealed her knowledge of that fact.\n",
        "\"Please,\" she began with a hint of tears in her voice, \"I have no one else to ask for help--you have been\n",
        "kind --\"\n",
        "\"All right!\" he grunted. \"All right! What's the young reprobate's name?\"\n",
        "\"Why--Alafdhal. I am Zabibi, a dancing-girl. I have danced often before the satrap, Jungir Khan, and his\n",
        "mistress Nafertari, and before all the lords and royal ladies of Zamboula. Totrasmek desired me and,\n",
        "because I repulsed him, he made me the innocent tool of his vengeance against Alafdhal. I asked a love\n",
        "potion of Totrasmek, not suspecting the depth of his guile and hate. He gave me a drug to mix with my\n",
        "lover's wine, and he swore that when Alafdhal drank it, he would love me even more madly than ever\n",
        "and grant my every wish. I mixed the drug secretly with my lover's wine. But having drunk, my lover\n",
        "went raving mad and things came about as I have told you. Curse Totrasmek, the hybrid snake--ahhh!\"\n",
        "She caught his arm convulsively and both stopped short. They had come into a district of shops and stalls,\n",
        "all deserted and unlighted, for the hour was late. They were passing an alley, and in its mouth a man was\n",
        "standing, motionless and silent. His head was lowered, but Conan caught the wierd gleam of eery eyes\n",
        "regarding them unblinkingly. His skin crawled, not with fear of the sword in the man's hand, but because\n",
        "of the uncanny suggestion of his posture and silence. They suggested madness. Conan pushed the girl\n",
        "aside and drew his sword.\n",
        "\"Don't kill him!\" she begged. \"In the name of Set, do not slay him! You are strong--overpower him!\"\n",
        "\"We'll see,\" he muttered, grasping his sword in his right hand and clenching his left into a mallet-like fist.\n",
        "He took a wary step toward the alley--and with a horrible moaning laugh the Tauranian charged. As he\n",
        "came he swung his sword, rising on his toes as he put all the power of his body behind the blows. Sparks \n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "385\n",
        "flashed blue as Conan parried the blade, and the next instant the madman was stretched senseless in the\n",
        "dust from a thundering buffet of Conan's left fist.\n",
        "The girl ran forward.\n",
        "\"Oh, he is not--he is not --\"\n",
        "Conan bent swiftly, turned the man on his side, and ran quick fingers over him.\n",
        "\"He's not hurt much,\" he grunted. \"Bleeding at the nose, but anybody's likely to do that, after a clout on\n",
        "the jaw. He'll come to after a bit, and maybe his mind will be right. In the meantime I'll tie his wrists with\n",
        "his sword belt--so. Now where do you want me to take him?\"\n",
        "\"Wait!\" She knelt beside the senseless figure, seized the bound hands, and scanned them avidly. Then,\n",
        "shaking her head as if in baffled disappointment, she rose. She came close to the giant Cimmerian and\n",
        "laid her slender hands on his arching breast. Her dark eyes, like wet black jewels in the starlight, gazed\n",
        "up into his.\n",
        "\"You are a man! Help me! Totrasmek must die! Slay him for me!\"\n",
        "\"And put my neck into a Turanian noose?\" he grunted.\n",
        "\"Nay!\" The slender arms, strong as pliant steel, were around his corded neck. Her supple body throbbed\n",
        "against his. \"The Hyrkanians have no love for Totrasmek. The priests of Set fear him. He is a mongrel,\n",
        "who rules men by fear and superstition. I worship Set, and the Turanians bow to Erlik, but Totrasmek\n",
        "sacrifices to Hanuman the accursed! The Turanian lords fear his black arts and his power over the hybrid\n",
        "popularion, and they hate him. Even Jungir Khan and his mistress Nafertari fear and hate him. If he were\n",
        "slain in his temple at night, they would not seek his slayer very closely.\"\n",
        "\"And what of his magic?\" rumbled the Cimmerian.\n",
        "\"You are a fighting man,\" she answered. \"To risk your life is part of your profession.\"\n",
        "\"For a price,\" he admitted.\n",
        "\"There will be a price!\" she breathed, rising on tiptoes, to gaze into his eyes.\n",
        "The nearness of her vibrant body drove a flame through his veins. The perfume of her breath mounted to\n",
        "his brain. But as his arms closed about her supple figure she avoided them with a lithe movement, saying:\n",
        "\"Wait! First serve me in this matter.\"\n",
        "\"Name your price.\" He spoke with some difficulty.\n",
        "\"Pick up my lover,\" she directed, and the Cimmerian stooped and swung the tall form easily to his broad\n",
        "shoulder. At the moment he felt as if he could have toppled over Jungir Khan's palace with equal ease.\n",
        "The girl murmured an endearment to the unconscious man, and there was no hypocrisy in her attitude.\n",
        "She obviously loved Alafdhal sincerely. Whatever business arrangement she made with Conan would\n",
        "have no bearing on her relationship with Alafdhal. Women are more practical about these things than\n",
        "men.\n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "386\n",
        "\"Follow me!\" She hurried along the street, while the Cimmerian strode easily after her, in no way\n",
        "discomforted by his limp burden. He kept a wary eye out for black shadows skulking under arches but\n",
        "saw nothing suspicious. Doubtless the men of Darfar were all gathered at the roasting pit. The girl turned\n",
        "down a narrow side street and presently knocked cautiously at an arched door.\n",
        "Almost instantly a wicket opened in the upper panel and a black face glanced out. She bent close to the\n",
        "opening, whispering swiftly. Bolts creaked in their sockets, and the door opened. A giant black man\n",
        "stood framed against the soft glow of a copper lamp. A quick glance showed Conan the man was not\n",
        "from Darfar. His teeth were unfiled and his kinky hair was cropped close to his skull. He was from the\n",
        "Wadai.\n",
        "At a word from Zabibi, Conan gave the limp body into the black's arms and saw the young officer laid on\n",
        "a velvet divan. He showed no signs of returning consciousness. The blow that had rendered him\n",
        "senseless might have felled an ox. Zabibi bent over him for an instant, her fingers nervously twining and\n",
        "twisting. Then she straightened and beckoned the Cimmerian.\n",
        "The door closed softly, the locks clicked behind them, and the closing wicket shut off the glow of the\n",
        "lamps. In the starlight of the street Zabibi took Conan's hand. Her own hand trembled a little.\n",
        "\"You will not fail me?\"\n",
        "He shook his maned head, massive against the stars.\n",
        "\"Then follow me to Hanuman's shrine, and the gods have mercy on our souls.\"\n",
        "Among the silent streets they moved like phantoms of antiquity. They went in silence. Perhaps the girl\n",
        "was thinking of her lover lying senseless on the divan under the copper lamps or was shrinking with fear\n",
        "of what lay ahead of them in the demon-haunted shrine of Hanuman. The barbarian was thinking only of\n",
        "the woman moving so supplely beside him. The perfume of her scented hair was in his nostrils, the\n",
        "sensuous aura of her presence filled his brain and left room for no other thoughts.\n",
        "Once they heard the clank of brass-shod feet, and drew into the shadows of a gloomy arch while a squad\n",
        "of Pelishti watchmen swung past. There were fifteen of them; they marched in close formation, pikes at\n",
        "the ready, and the rearmost men had their broad, brass shields slung on their backs, to protect them from\n",
        "a knife stroke from behind. The skulking menace of the black maneaters was a threat even to armed men.\n",
        "As soon as the clang of their sandals had receded up the street, Conan and the girl emerged from their\n",
        "hiding place and hurried on. A few moments later, they saw the squat, flat-topped edifice they sought\n",
        "looming ahead of them.\n",
        "The temple of Hanuman stood alone in the midst of a broad square, which lay silent and deserted\n",
        "beneath the stars. A marble wall surrounded the shrine, with a broad opening directly before the portico.\n",
        "This opening had no gate nor any sort of barrier.\n",
        "\"Why don't the blacks seek their prey here?\" muttered Conan. \"There's nothing to keep them out of the\n",
        "temple.\"\n",
        "He could feel the trembling of Zabibi's body as she pressed close to him.\n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "387\n",
        "\"They fear Totrasmek, as all in Zamboula fear him, even Jungir Khan and Nafertari. Come! Come quickly,\n",
        "before my courage flows from me like water!\"\n",
        "The girl's fear was evident, but she did not falter. Conan drew his sword and strode ahead of her as they\n",
        "advanced through the open gateway. He knew the hideous habits of the priests of the East and was\n",
        "aware that an invader of Hanuman's shrine might expect to encounter almost any sort of nightmare\n",
        "horror. He knew there was a good chance that neither he nor the girl would ever leave the shrine alive,\n",
        "but he had risked his life too many times before to devote much thought to that consideration.\n",
        "They entered a court paved with marble which gleamed whitely in the starlight. A short flight of broad\n",
        "marble steps led up to the pillared portico. The great bronze doors stood wide open as they had stood for\n",
        "centuries. But no worshippers burnt incense within. In the day men and women might come timidly into\n",
        "the shirne and place offerings to the ape-god on the black altar. At night the people shunned the temple\n",
        "of Hanuman as hares shun the lair of the serpent.\n",
        "Burning censers bathed the interior in a soft, weird glow that created an illusion of unreality. Near the\n",
        "rear wall, behind the black stone altar, sat the god with his gaze fixed for ever on the open door, through\n",
        "which for centuries his victims had come, dragged by chains of roses. A faint groove ran from the sill to\n",
        "the altar, and when Conan's foot felt it, he stepped away as quickly as if he had trodden upon a snake.\n",
        "That groove had been worn by the faltering feet of the multitude of those who had died screaming on\n",
        "that grim altar.\n",
        "Bestial in the uncertain light, Hanuman leered with his carven mask. He sat, not as an ape would crouch,\n",
        "but cross-legged as a man would sit, but his aspect was no less simian for that reason. He was carved\n",

        "pits. His great hands lay upon his lap, palms upward, taloned fingers spread and grasping. In the gross\n",
        "emphasis of his attributes, in the leer of his satyr-countenance, was reflected the abominable cynicism of\n",
        "the degererate cult which deified him.\n",
        "The girl moved around the image, making toward the back wall, and when her sleek flank brushed\n",
        "against a carven knee, she shrank aside and shuddered as if a reptile had touched her. There was a space\n",
        "of several feet between the broad back of the idol and the marble wall with its frieze of gold leaves. On\n",
        "either hand, flanking the idol, an ivory door under a gold arch was set in the wall.\n",
        "\"Those doors open into each end of a hairpin-shaped corridor,\" she said hurriedly. \"Once I was in the\n",
        "interior of the shrine--once!\" She shivered and twitched her slim shoulders at a memory both terrifying\n",
        "and obscene. \"The corridor is bent like a horseshoe, with each horn opening into this room. Totrasmek's\n",
        "chambers are enclosed within the curve of the corridor and open into it. But there is a secret door in this\n",

        "She began to run her hands over the smooth surface, where no crack or crevice showed. Conan stood\n",
        "beside her, sword in hand, glancing warily about him. The silence, the emptiness of the shrine, with\n",
        "imagination picturing what might lie behind that wall, made him feel like a wild beast nosing a trap.\n",
        "\"Ah!\" The girl had found a hidden spring at last; a square opening gaped blackly in the wall. Then: \"Set!\"\n",
        "she screamed, and even as Conan leaped toward her, he saw that a great misshapen hand has fastened\n",
        "itself in her hair. She was snatched off her feet and jerked headfirst through the opening. Conan, grabbing \n",

        "ineffectually at her, felt his fingers slip from a naked limb, and in an instant she had vanished and the\n",
        "wall showed black as before. Only from beyond it came the muffled sounds of a struggle, a scream,\n",
        "faintly heard, and a low laugh that made Conan's blood congeal in his veins.\n",

        "\n",
        "With an oath the Cimmerian smote the wall a terrible blow with the pommel of his sword, and the marble\n",
        "cracked and chipped. But the hidden door did not give way, and reason told him that doubtless it had\n",
        "been bolted on the other side of the wall. Turning, he sprang across the chamber to one of the ivory doors.\n",
        "He lifted his sword to shatter the panels, but on a venture tried the door first with is left hand. It swung\n",
        "open easily, and he glared into a long corridor that curved away into dimness under the weird light of\n",
        "censers similar to those in the shrine. A heavy gold bolt showed on the jamb of the door, and he touched\n",
        "it lightly with his fingertips. The faint warmness of the metal could have been detected only by a man\n",
        "whose faculties were akin to those of a wolf. That bolt had been touched--and therefore drawn--within\n",
        "the last few seconds. The affair was taking on more and more of the aspect of a baited trap. He might\n",
        "have known Totrasmek would know when anyone entered the temple.\n",
        "To enter the corridor would undoubtedly be to walk into whatever trap the priest had set for him. But\n",
        "Conan did not hesitate. Somewhere in that dim-lit interior Zabibi was a captive, and, from what he knew\n",
        "of the characteristics of Hanuman's priests, he was sure that she needed help badly. Conan stalked into\n",
        "the corridor with a pantherish tread, poised to strike right or left.\n",
        "On his left, ivory, arched doors opened into the corridor, and he tried each in turn. All were locked. He\n",
        "had gone perhaps seventy-five feet when the corridor bent sharply to the left, describing the curve the\n",
        "girl had mentioned. A door opened into this curve, and it gave under his hand.\n",
        "He was looking into a broad, square chamber, somewhat more clearly lighted than the corridor. Its walls\n",
        "were of white marble, the floor of ivory, the ceiling of fretted silver. He saw divans of rich satin, goldworked footstools of ivory, a disk-shaped table of some massive, metal-like substance. On one of the\n",
        "divans a man was reclining, looking toward the door. He laughed as he met the Cimmerian's startled\n",
        "glare.\n",
        "This man was naked except for a loin cloth and high-strapped sandals. He was brown-skinned, with\n",
        "close-cropped black hair and restless black eyes that set off a broad, arrogant face. In girth and breadth he\n",
        "was enormous, with huge limbs on which the great muscles swelled and rippled at each slightest\n",
        "movement. His hands were the largest Conan had ever seen. The assurance of gigantic physical strength\n",
        "colored his every action and inflection.\n",
        "\"Why not enter, barbarian?\" he called mockingly, with an exaggerated gesture of invitation.\n",
        "Conan's eyes began to smolder ominously, but he trod warily into the chamber, his sword ready.\n",
        "\"Who the devil are you?\" he growled.\n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "389\n",
        "\"I am Baal-pteor,\" the man answered. \"Once, long ago and in another land, I had another name. But this is\n",
        "a good name, and why Totrasmek gave it to me, any temple wench can tell you.\"\n",
        "\"So you're his dog!\" grunted Conan. \"Well, curse your brown hide, Baal-pteor, where's the wench you\n",
        "jerked through the wall?\"\n",
        "\"My master entertains her!\" laughed Baal-pteor. \"Listen!\"\n",
        "From beyond a door opposite the one by which Conan had entered there sounded a woman's scream,\n",
        "faint and muffled in the distance.\n",
        "\"Blast your soul!\" Conan took a stride toward the door, then wheeled with his skin tingling, Baal-pteor\n",
        "was laughing at him, and that laugh was edged with menace that made the hackles rise on Conan's neck\n",
        "and sent a red wave of murder-lust driving across his vision.\n",
        "He started toward Baal-pteor, the knuckles on his swordhand showing white. With a swift motion the\n",
        "brown man threw something at him--a shining crystal sphere that glistened in the weird light.\n",
        "Conan dodged instinctively, but, miraculously, the globe stopped short in midair, a few feet from his face.\n",
        "It did not fall to the floor. It hung suspended, as if by invisible filaments, some five feet above the floor.\n",
        "And as he glared in amazement, it began to rotate with growing speed. And as it revolved it grew,\n",
        "expanded, became nebulous. It filled the chamber. It enveloped him. It blotted out furniture, walls, the\n",
        "smiling countenance of Baal-pteor. He was lost in the midst of a blinding bluish blur of whirling speed.\n",
        "Terrific winds screamed past Conan, tugging at him, striving to wrench him from his feet, to drag him\n",
        "into the vortex that spun madly before him.\n",
        "With a choking cry Conan lurched backward, reeled, felt the solid wall against his back. At the contact\n",
        "the illusion ceased to be. The whirling, titanic sphere vanished like a bursting bubble. Conan reeled\n",
        "upright in the silver-ceilinged room, with a gray mist coiling about his feet, and saw Baal-pteor lolling on\n",
        "the divan, shaking with silent laughter.\n",
        "\"Son of a slut!\" Conan lunged at him. But the mist swirled up from the floor, blotting out that giant brown\n",
        "form. Groping in a rolling cloud that blinded him, Conan felt a rending sensation of dislocation--and then\n",
        "room and mist and brown man were gone together. He was standing alone among the high reeds of a\n",
        "marshy fen, and a buffalo was lunging at him, head down. He leaped aside from the ripping scimitarcurved horns and drove his sword in behind the foreleg, through ribs and heart. And then it was not a\n",
        "buffalo dying there in the mud, but the brown-skinned Baal-pteor. With a curse Conan struck off his head;\n",
        "and the head soared from the ground and snapped beastlike tusks into his throat. For all his mighty\n",
        "strength he could not tear it loose--he was choking--strangling; then there was a rush and roar through\n",
        "space, the dislocating shock of an immeasurable impact, and he was back in the chamber with Baal-pteor,\n",
        "whose head was once more set firmly on his shoulders, and who laughed silently at him from the divan.\n",
        "\"Mesmerism!\" muttered Conan, crouching and digging his toes hard against the marble.\n",
        "His eyes blazed. This brown dog was playing with him, making sport of him! But this mummery, this\n",
        "child's play of mists and shadows of thought, it could not harm him. He had but to leap and strike and\n",
        "the brown acolyte would be a mangled corpse under his heel. This time he would not be fooled by\n",
        "shadows of illusion--but he was.\n",

        "390\n",
        "A blood-curdling snarl sounded behind him, and he wheeled and struck in a flash at the panther\n",
        "crouching to spring on him from the metal-colored table. Even as he struck, the apparition vanished and\n",
        "his blade clashed deafeningly on the adamantine surface. Instantly he sensed something abnormal. The\n",
        "blade stuck to the table! He wrenched at it savagely. It did not give. This was no mesmeristic trick. The\n",
        "table was a giant magnet. He gripped the hilt with both hands, when a voice at his shoulder brought him\n",
        "about, to face the brown man, who had at last risen from the divan.\n",
        "Slightly taller than Conan and much heavier, Baal-pteor loomed before him, a daunting image of\n",
        "muscular development. His mighty arms were unnaturally long, and his great hands opened and closed,\n",
        "twitching convulsively. Conan released the hilt of his imprisoned sword and fell silent, watching his\n",
        "enemy thorugh slitted lids.\n",
        "\"Your head, Cimmerian!\" taunted Baal-pteor. \"I shall take it with my bare hands, twisting it from your\n",
        "shoulders as the head of a fowl is twisted! Thus the sons of Kosala offer sacrifice to Yajur. Barbarian, you\n",
        "look upon a strangler of Yota-pong. I was chosen by the priests of Yajur in my infancy, and throughout\n",
        "childhood, boyhood, and youth I was trained in the art of slaying with the naked hands--for only thus are\n",
        "the sacrifices enacted. Yajur loves blood, and we waste not a drop from the victim's veins. When I was a\n",
        "child they gave me infants to throttle; when I was a boy I strangled young girls; as a youth, women, old\n",
        "men, and young boys. Not until I reached my full manhood was I given a strong man to slay on the altar\n",
        "of Yota-pong.\n",
        "\"For years I offered the sacrifices to Yajur. Hundreds of necks have snapped between these fingers--\" he\n",
        "worked them before the Cimmerian's angry eyes. \"Why I fled from Yota-pong to become Totrasmek's\n",
        "servant is no concern of yours. In a moment you will be beyond curiosity. The priests of Kosala, the\n",
        "stranglers of Yajur, are strong beyond the belief of men. And I was stronger than any. With my hands,\n",
        "barbarian, I shall break your neck!\"\n",
        "And like the stroke of twin cobras, the great hands closed on Conan's throat. The Cimmerian made no\n",
        "attempt to dodge or fend them away, but his own hands darted to the Kosalan's bull-neck. Baal-pteor's\n",
        "black eyes widened as he felt the thick cords of muscles that protected the barbarian's throat. With a snarl\n",
        "he exerted his inhuman strength, and knots and lumps and ropes of thews rose along his massive arms.\n",
        "And then a choking gasp burst from him as Conan's fingers locked on his throat. For an instant they\n",
        "stood there like statues, their faces masks of effort, veins beginning to stand out purply on their temples.\n",
        "Conan's thin lips drew back from his teeth in a grinning snarl. Baal-pteor's eyes were distended and in\n",
        "them grew an awful surprise and the glimmer of fear. Both men stood motionless as images, except for\n",
        "the expanding of their muscles on rigid arms and braced legs, but strength beyond common conception\n",
        "was warring there--strength that might have uprooted trees and crushed the skulls of bullocks.\n",
        "The wind whistled suddenly from between Baal-pteor's parted teeth. His face was growing purple. Fear\n",
        "flooded his eyes. His thews seemed ready to burst from his arms and shoulders, yet the muscles of the\n",
        "Cimmerian's thick neck did not give; they felt like masses of woven iron cords under his desperate\n",
        "fingers. But his own flesh was giving way under the iron fingers of the Cimmerian which ground deeper\n",
        "and deeper into the yielding throat muscles, crushing them in upon jugular and windpipe.\n",
        "The statuesque immobility of the group gave way to sudden, frenzied motion, as the Kosalan began to\n",
        "wrench and heave, seeking to throw himself backward. He let go of Conan's throat and grasped his\n",
        "wrists, trying to tear away those inexorable fingers.\n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "391\n",
        "With a sudden lunge Conan bore him backward until the small of his back crashed against the table. And\n",
        "still farther over its edge Conan bent him, back and back, until his spine was ready to snap.\n",
        "Conan's low laugh was merciless as the ring of steel.\n",
        "\"You fool!\" he all but whispered. \"I think you never saw a man from the West before. Did you deem\n",
        "yourself strong, because you were able to twist the heads off civilized folk, poor weaklings with muscles\n",
        "like rotten string? Hell! Break the neck of a wild Cimmerian bull before you call yourself strong. I did that,\n",
        "before I was a full-grown man--like this!\"\n",
        "And with a savage wrench he twisted Baal-pteor's head around until the ghastly face leered over the left\n",

        "Conan hurled the flopping corpse to the floor, turned to the sword again, and gripped the hilt with both\n",

        "that tore the sword from the magnet where it clung.\n",

        "curtain, and from beyond that curtain came the devilish strains of such music as Conan had never heard,\n",
        "not even in nightmares. It made the short hairs bristle on the back of his neck. Mingled with it was the\n",

        "the girl dancing desperately between four swaying spirals of smoke, but he had guessed that their\n",
        "appearance was very different to her. He knew he had killed Totrasmek.\n",
        "Zabibi sank down on the floor, panting, but even as Conan started toward her, she staggered up again,\n",
        "though her legs trembled with exhaustion.\n",
        "\"The phial!\" she gasped. \"The phial!\"\n",
        "Totrasmek still grasped it in his stiffening hand. Ruthlessly she tore it from ihs locked fingers and then\n",
        "began frantically to ransack his garments.\n",
        "\"What the devil are you looking for?\" Conan demanded.\n",
        "\"A ring--he stole it from Alafdhal. He must have, while my lover walked in madness through the streets.\n",
        "Set's devils!\"\n",
        "She had convinced herself that it was not on the person of Totrasmek. She began to cast about the\n",
        "chamber, tearing up divan covers and hangings and upsetting vessels.\n",
        "She paused and raked a damp lock of hair out of her eyes.\n",
        "\"I forgot Baal-pteor!\"\n",
        "\"He's in Hell with his neck broken,\" Conan assured her.\n",
        "She expressed vindictive gratification at the news, but an instant later swore expressively.\n",
        "\"We can't stay here. It's not many hours until dawn. Lesser priests are likely to visit the temple at any\n",

        "Turanians could not save us.\"\n",
        "She lifted the bolt on the secret door, and a few moments later they were in the streets and hurrying away\n",
        "from the silent square where brooded the age-old shrine of Hanuman.\n",
        "In a winding street a short distance away, Conan halted and checked his companion with a heavy hand\n",
        "on her naked shoulder.\n",
        "\"Don't forget there was a price--\"\n",
        "\"I have not forgotten!\" She twisted free. \"But we must go to--to Alafdhal first!\"\n",
        "A few minutes later the black slave let them through the wicket door. The young Turanian lay upon the\n",
        "divan, his arms and legs bound with heavy velvet ropes. His eyes were open, but they were like those of\n",
        "a mad dog, and foam was thick on his lips. Zabibi shuddered.\n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "395\n",
        "\"Force his jaws open!\" she commanded, and Conan's iron fingers accomplished the task.\n",
        "Zabibi emptied the phial down the maniac's gullet. The effect was like magic. Instantly he became quiet.\n",
        "The glare faded from his eyes; he stared up at the girl in a puzzled way, but with recognition and\n",
        "intelligence. Then he fell into a normal slumber.\n",
        "\"When he awakes he will be quite sane,\" she whispered, motioning to the silent slave.\n",
        "With a deep bow he gave into her hands a small leater bag and drew about her shoulders a silken cloak.\n",
        "Her manner had subtly changed when she beckoned Conan to follow her out of the chamber.\n",
        "In an arch that opened on the street, she turned to him, drawing herself up with a new regality.\n",
        "\"I must now tell you the truth,\" she said. \"I am not Zabibi. I am Nafertari. And he is not Alafdhal, a poor\n",
        "captain of the guardsmen. He is Jungir Khan, satrap of Zamboula.\"\n",
        "Conan made no comment; his scarred dark countenance was immobile.\n",
        "\"I lied to you because I dared not divulge the truth to anyone,\" she said. \"We were alone when Jungir\n",
        "Khan went mad. None knew of it but myself. Had it been known that the satrap of Zamboula was a\n",
        "madman, there would have been instant revolt and rioting, even as Totrasmek planned, who plotted our\n",
        "distruction.\n",
        "\"You see now how impossible is the reward for which you hoped. The satrap's mistress is not--cannot be\n",
        "for you. But you shall not go unrewarded. Here is a sack of gold.\"\n",
        "She gave him the bag she had received from the slave.\n",
        "\"Go now, and when the sun is up come to the palace. I will have Jungir Khan make you captain of his\n",
        "guard. But you will take your orders from me, secretly. Your first duty will be to march a squad to the\n",
        "shrine of Hanuman, ostensibly to search for clues of the priest's slayer; in reality to search for the Star of\n",
        "Khorala. It must be hidden there somewhere. When you find it, bring it to me. You have my leave to go\n",
        "now.\"\n",
        "He nodded, still silent, and strode away. The girl, watching the swing of his broad shoulders, was piqued\n",
        "to note that there was nothing in his bearing to show that he was in any way chagrined or abashed.\n",
        "When he had rounded a corner, he glanced back, and then changed his direction and quickened his pace.\n",
        "A few moments later he was in the quarter of the city containing the Horse Market. There he smote on a\n",
        "door until from the window above a bearded head was thrust to demand the reason for the disturbance.\n",
        "\"A horse,\" demanded Conan. \"The swiftest steed you have.\"\n",
        "\"I open no gates at this time of night,\" grumbled the horse trader.\n",
        "Conan rattled his coins.\n",
        "\"Dog's son knave! Don't you see I'm white, and alone? Come down, before I smash your door!\"\n",
        "Presently, on a bay stallion, Conan was riding toward the house of Aram Baksh.\n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "396\n",
        "He turned off the road into the alley that lay between the tavern compound and the date-palm garden,\n",
        "but he did not pause at the gate. He rode on to the northeast corner of the wall, then turned and rode\n",
        "along the north wall, to halt within a few paces of the northwest angle. No trees grew near the wall, but\n",
        "there were some low bushes. To one of these he tied his horse and was about to climb into the saddle\n",
        "again, when he heard a low muttering of voices beyond the corner of the wall.\n",
        "Drawing his foot from the stirrup he stole to the angle and peered around it. Three men were moving\n",
        "down the road toward the palm groves, and from their slouching gait he knew they were Negroes. They\n",
        "halted at his low call, bunching themselves as he strode toward them, his sword in his hand. Their eyes\n",
        "gleamed whitely in the starlight. Their brutish lust shone in their ebony faces, but they knew their three\n",
        "cudgels could not prevail against his sword, just as he knew it.\n",
        "\"Where are you going?\" he challenged.\n",
        "\"To bid our brothers put out the fire in the pit beyond the groves,\" was the sullen gutteral reply. \"Aram\n",
        "Baksh promised us a man, but he lied. We found one of our brothers dead in the trap-chamber. We go\n",
        "hungry this night.\"\n",
        "\"I think not,\" smiled Conan. \"Aram Baksh will give you a man. Do you see that door?\"\n",
        "He pointed to a small, iron-bound portal set in the midst of the western wall.\n",
        "\"Wait there. Aram Baksh will give you a man.\"\n",
        "Backing warily away until he was out of reach of a sudden bludgeon blow, he turned and melted around\n",
        "the northwest angle of the wall. Reaching his horse he paused to ascertain that the blacks were not\n",
        "sneaking after him, and then he climbed into the saddle and stood upright on it, quieting the uneasy\n",
        "steed with a low word. He reached up, grasped the coping of the wall and drew himself up and over.\n",
        "There he studied the grounds for an instant. The tavern was built in the southwest corner of the enclosure,\n",
        "the remaining space of which was occupied by groves and gardens. He saw no one in the grounds. The\n",
        "tavern was dark and silent, and he knew all the doors and windows were barred and bolted.\n",
        "Conan knew that Aram Baksh slept in a chamber that opened into a cypress-bordered path that led to the\n",
        "door in the western wall. Like a shadow he glided among the trees, and a few moments later he rapped\n",
        "lightly on the chamber door.\n",
        "\"What is it?\" asked a rumbling, sleepy voice from within.\n",
        "\"Aram Baksh!\" hissed Conan. \"The blacks are stealing over the wall!\"\n",
        "Almost instantly the door opened, framing the tavern-keeper, naked but for his shirt, with a dagger in his\n",
        "hand.\n",
        "He craned his neck to stare into the Cimmerian's face.\n",
        "\"What tale is this--you!\"\n",
        "Conan's vengeful fingers strangled the yell in his throat. They went to the floor together and Conan\n",
        "wrenched the dagger from his enemy's hand. The blade glinted in the starlight, and blood spurted. Aram \n",
        "Shadows in Zamboula\n",
        "397\n",
        "Baksh made hideous noises, gasping and gagging on a mouthful of blood. Conan dragged him to his feet\n",
        "and again the dagger slashed, and most of the curly beard fell to the floor.\n",
        "Still gripping his captive's throat--for a man can scream incoherently even with his throat slit--Conan\n",
        "dragged him out of the dark chamber and down the cypress-shadowed path, to the iron-bound door in\n",
        "the outer wall. With one hand he lifted the bolt and threw the door open, disclosing the three shadowy\n",
        "figures which waited like black vultures outside. Into their eager arms Conan thrust the innkeeper.\n",
        "A horrible, blood-choked scream rose from the Zamboulan's throat, but there was no response from the\n",
        "silent tavern. The people there were used to screams outside the wall. Aram Baksh fought like a wild man,\n",
        "his distended eyes turned frantically on the Cimmerian's face. He found no mercy there. Conan was\n",
        "thinking of the scores of wretches who owed their bloody doom to this man's greed.\n",
        "In glee the Negroes dragged him down the road, mocking his frenzied gibberings. How could they\n",
        "recognize Aram Baksh in this half-naked, bloodstained figure, with the grotesquely shorn beard and\n",
        "unintelligible babblings? The sounds of the struggle came back to Conan, standing beside the gate, even\n",
        "after the clump of figures had vanished among the palms.\n",
        "Closing the door behind him, Conan returned to his horse, mounted, and turned westward, toward the\n",
        "open desert, swinging wide to skirt the sinister belt of palm groves. As he rode, he drew from his belt a\n",
        "ring in which gleamed a jewel that snared the starlight in a shimmering iridescence. He held it up to\n",
        "admire it, turning it this way and that. The compact bag of gold pieces clinked gently at his saddle bow,\n",
        "like a promise of the greater riches to come.\n",
        "\"I wonder what she'd say if she knew I recognized her as Nafetari and him as Jungir Khan the instant I\n",
        "saw them,\" he mused. \"I knew the Star of Khorala, too. There'll be a fine scene if she ever guesses that I\n",
        "slipped it off his finger while I was tying him with his sword belt. But they'll never catch me, with the\n",
        "start I'm getting.\"\n",
        "He glanced back at the shadowy palm groves, among which a red glare was mounting. A chanting rose\n",
        "to the night, vibrating with savage exultation. And another sound mingled with it, a mad incoherent\n",
        "screaming, a frenzied gibbering in which no words could be distinguished. The noise followed Conan as\n",
        "he rode westward beneath the paling stars.\n",

        "foot out of the silver stirrup and swung down from the gilt-worked saddle. She made the reins fast to the\n",
        "fork of a sapling, and turned about, hands on her hips, to survey her surroundings.\n",
        "They were not inviting. Giant trees hemmed in the small pool where her horse had just drunk. Clumps of\n",

        "intertwining branches. The woman shivered with a twitch of her magnificent shoulders, and then cursed.\n",
        "She was tall, full-bosomed, and large-limbed, with compact shoulders. Her whole figure reflected an\n",
        "unusual strength, without detracting from the femininity of her appearance. She was all woman, in spite\n",
        "of her bearing and her garments. The latter were incongruous, in view of her present environs. Instead of\n",
        "a skirt she wore short, wide-legged silk breeches, which ceased a hand's breadth short of her knees, and\n",
        "were upheld by a wide silken sash worn as a girdle. Flaring-topped boots of soft leather came almost to\n",
        "her knees, and a low-necked, wide-collared, wide-sleeved silk shirt completed her costume. On one\n",
        "shapely hip she wore a straight double-edged sword, and on the other a long dirk. Her unruly golden\n",
        "hair, cut square at her shoulders, was confined by a band of crimson satin.\n",
        "Against the background of somber, primitive forest she posed with an unconscious picturesqueness,\n",
        "bizarre and out of place. She should have been posed against a background of sea clouds, painted masts,\n",
        "and wheeling gulls. There was the color of the sea in her wide eyes. And that was at it should have been,\n",
        "because this was Valeria of the Red Brotherhood, whose deeds are celebrated in song and ballad\n",
        "wherever seafarers gather.\n",
        "She strove to pierce the sullen green roof of the arched branches and see the sky which presumably lay\n",
        "above it, but presently gave it up with a muttered oath.\n",
        "Leaving her horse tied, she strode off toward the east, glancing back toward the pool from time to time in\n",
        "order to fix her route in her mind. The silence of the forest depressed her. No birds sang in the lofty\n",
        "boughs, nor did any rustling in the bushes indicate the presence of small animals. For leagues she had\n",
        "traveled in a realm of brooding stillness, broken only by the sounds of her own flight.\n",
        "She had slaked her thirst at the pool, but now felt the gnawings of hunger and began looking about for\n",

        "Ahead of her, presently, she saw an outcropping of dark, flintlike rock that sloped upward into what\n",
        "looked like a rugged crag rising among the trees. Its summit was lost to view amidst a cloud of encircling\n",
        "leaves. Perhaps its peak rose above the treetops, and from it she could see what lay beyond--if, indeed,\n",
        "anything lay beyond but more of this apparently illimitable forest through which she had ridden for so\n",
        "many days.\n",
        "A narrow ridge formed a natural ramp that led up the steep face of the crag. After she had ascended\n",
        "some fifty feet, she came to the belt of leaves that surrounded the rock. The trunks of the trees did not\n",
        "crowd close to the crag, but the ends of their lower branches extended about it, veiling it with their\n",
        "foliage. She groped on in leafy obscurity, not able to see either above or below her; but presently she\n",
        "glimpsed blue sky, and a moment later came out in the clear, hot sunlight and saw the forest roof\n",
        "stretching away under her feet.\n",
        "She was standing on a broad shelf which was about even with the treetops, and from it rose a spirelike jut\n",
        "that was the ultimate peak of the crag she had climbed. But something else caught her attention at the\n",
        "moment. Her foot had struck something in the litter of blown dead leaves which carpeted the shelf. She\n",
        "kicked them aside and looked down on the skeleton of a man. She ran an experienced eye over the\n",
        "bleached frame, but saw no broken bones nor any sign of violence. The man must have died a natural\n",
        "death; though why he should have climbed a tall crag to die she could not imagine.\n",
        "She scrambled up to the summit of the spire and looked toward the horizons. The forest roof--which\n",
        "looked like a floor from her vantage point--was just as impenetrable as from below. She could not even\n",
        "see the pool by which she had left her horse. She glanced northward, in the direction from which she had\n",
        "come. She saw only the rolling green ocean stretching away and away, with just a vague blue line in the\n",
        "distance to hint of the hill range she had crossed days before, to plunge into this leafy waste.\n",
        "West and east the view was the same; though the blue hill-line was lacking in those directions. But when\n",
        "she turned her eyes southward she stiffened and caught her breath. A mile away in that direction the\n",
        "forest thinned out and ceased abruptly, giving way to a cactus-dotted plain. And in the midst of that\n",
        "plain rose the walls and towers of a city. Valeria swore in amazement. This passed belief. She would not\n",
        "have been surprised to sight human habitations of another sort--the beehive-shaped huts of the black\n",
        "people, or the cliff-dwellings of the mysterious brown race which legends declared inhabited some\n",
        "country of this unexplored region. But it was a startling experience to come upon a walled city here so\n",
        "many long weeks' march from the nearest outposts of any sort of civilization.\n",
        "Her hands tiring from clinging to the spirelike pinnacle, she let herself down on the shelf, frowning in\n",
        "indecision. She had come far--from the camp of the mercenaries by the border town of Sukhmet amidst\n",
        "the level grasslands, where desperate adventurers of many races guard the Stygian frontier against the\n",
        "raids that come up like a red wave from Darfar. Her flight had been blind, into a country of which she\n",
        "was wholly ignorant. And now she wavered between an urge to ride directly to that city in the plain, and\n",
        "the instinct of caution which prompted her to skirt it widely and continue her solitary flight.\n",
        "Her thoughts were scattered by the rustling of the leaves below her. She wheeled catlike, snatched at her\n",
        "sword; and then she froze motionless, staring wide-eyed at the man before her.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "400\n",
        "He was almost a giant in stature, muscles rippling smoothly under his skin, which the sun had burned\n",
        "brown. His garb was similar to hers, except that he wore a broad leather belt instead of a girdle.\n",
        "Broadsword and poniard hung from his belt.\n",
        "\"Conan, the Cimmerian!\" ejaculated the woman. \"What are you doing on my trail?\"\n",
        "He grinned hardly, and his fierce blue eyes burned with a light any woman could understand as they ran\n",
        "over her magnificent figure, lingering on the swell of her splendid breasts beneath the light shirt, and the\n",
        "clear white flesh displayed between breeches and boot-tops.\n",
        "\"Don't you know?\" he laughed. \"Haven't I made my admiration for you plain ever since I first saw you?\"\n",
        "\"A stallion could have made it no plainer,\" she answered disdainfully. \"But I never expected to encounter\n",
        "you so far from the ale barrels and meatpots of Sukhmet. Did you really follow me from Zarallo's camp,\n",
        "or were you whipped forth for a rogue?\"\n",
        "He laughed at her insolence and flexed his mighty biceps.\n",
        "\"You know Zarallo didn't have enough knaves to whip me out of camp,\" he grinned. \"Of course I\n",
        "followed you. Lucky thing for you, too, wench! When you knifed that Stygian officer, you forfeited\n",
        "Zarallo's favor, and protection, and you outlawed yourself with the Stygians.\"\n",
        "\"I know it,\" she replied sullenly. \"But what else could I do? You know what my provocation was.\"\n",
        "\"Sure,\" he agreed. \"If I'd been there, I'd have knifed him myself. But if a woman must live in the war\n",
        "camps of men, she can expect such things.\"\n",
        "Valeria stamped her booted foot and swore.\n",
        "\"Why won't men let me life a man's life?\"\n",
        "\"That's obvious!\" Again his eager eyes devoured her. \"But you were wise to run away. The Stygians\n",
        "would have had you skinned. That officer's brother followed you; faster than you thought, I don't doubt.\n",
        "He wasn't far behind you when I caught up with him. His horse was better than yours. He'd have caught\n",
        "you and cut your throat within a few more miles.\"\n",
        "\"Well?\" she demanded.\n",
        "\"Well what?\" He seemed puzzled.\n",
        "\"What of the Stygian?\"\n",
        "\"Why, what do you suppose?\" he returned impatiently. \"I killed him, of course, and left his carcass for the\n",
        "vultures. That delayed me, though, and I almost lost your trail when you crossed the rocky spurs of the\n",
        "hills. Otherwise I'd have caught up with you long ago.\"\n",
        "\"And now you think you'll drag me back to Zarallo's camp?\" she sneered.\n",
        "\"Don't talk like a fool,\" he grunted. \"Come, girl, don't be such a spitfire. I'm not like that Stygian you\n",
        "knifed, and you know it.\"\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "401\n",
        "\"A penniless vagabond,\" she taunted.\n",
        "He laughed at her.\n",
        "\"What do you call yourself? You haven't enough money to buy a new seat for your breeches. Your\n",
        "disdain doesn't deceive me. You know I've commanded bigger ships and more men than you ever did in\n",
        "your life. As for being penniless--what rover isn't, most of the time? I've squandered enough gold in the\n",
        "seaports of the world to fill a galleon. You know that, too.\"\n",
        "\"Where are the fine ships and the bold lads you commanded now?\" she sneered.\n",
        "\"At the bottom of the sea, mostly,\" he replied cheerfully. \"The Zingarans sank my last ship off the Shemite\n",
        "shore--that's why I joined Zarallo's Free Companions. But I saw I'd been stung when we marched to the\n",
        "Darfar border. The pay was poor and the wine was sour, and I don't like black women. And that's the\n",
        "only kind that came to our camp at Sukhmet--rings in their noses and their teeth filed--bah! Why did you\n",
        "join Zarallo? Sukhmet's a long way from salt water.\"\n",
        "\"Red Ortho wanted to make me his mistress,\" she answered sullenly. \"I jumped overboard one night and\n",
        "swam ashore when we were anchored off the Kushite coast. Off Zabhela, it was. There was a Shemite\n",
        "trader told me that Zarallo had brought his Free Companies south to guard the Darfar border. No better\n",
        "employment offered. I joined an east-bound caravan and eventually came to Sukhmet.\"\n",
        "\"It was madness to plunge southward as you did,\" commented Conan, \"but it was wise, too, for Zarallo's\n",
        "patrols never thought to look for you in this direction. Only the brother of the man you killed happened\n",
        "to strike your trail.\"\n",
        "\"And now what do you intend doing?\" she demanded.\n",
        "\"Turn west,\" he answered. \"I've been this far south, but not this far east. Many days' traveling to the west\n",
        "will bring us to the open savannas, where the black tribes graze their cattle. I have friends among them.\n",
        "We'll get to the coast and find a ship. I'm sick of the jungle.\"\n",
        "\"Then be on your way,\" she advised. \"I have other plans.\"\n",
        "\"Don't be a fool!\" He showed irritation for the first time. \"You can't keep on wandering through this\n",
        "forest.\"\n",
        "\"I can if I choose.\"\n",
        "\"But what do you intend doing?\"\n",
        "\"That's none of your affair,\" she snapped.\n",
        "\"Yes, it is,\" he answered calmly. \"Do you think I've followed you this far, to turn around and ride off\n",
        "empty-handed? Be sensible, wench. I'm not going to harm you.\"\n",
        "He stepped toward her, and she sprang back, whipping out her sword.\n",
        "\"Keep back, you barbarian dog! I'll spit you like a roast pig!\"\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "402\n",
        "He halted, reluctantly, and demanded: \"Do you want me to take that toy away from you and spank you\n",
        "with it?\"\n",
        "\"Words! Nothing but words!\" she mocked, lights like the gleam of the sun on blue water dancing in her\n",
        "reckless eyes.\n",
        "He knew it was the truth. No living man could disarm Valeria of the Brotherhood with his bare hands.\n",
        "He scowled, his sensations a tangle of conflicting emotions. He was angry, yet he was amused and filled\n",
        "with admiration for her spirit. He burned with eagerness to seize that splendid figure and crush it in his\n",
        "iron arms, yet he greatly desired not to hurt the girl. He was torn between a desire to shake her soundly,\n",
        "and a desire to caress her. He knew if he came any nearer her sword would be sheathed in his heart. He\n",
        "had seen Valeria kill too many men in border forays and tavern brawls to have any illusions about her.\n",
        "He knew she was as quick and ferocious as a tigress. He could draw his broadsword and disarm her, beat\n",
        "the blade out of her hand, but the thought of drawing a sword on a woman, even without intent of injury,\n",
        "was extremely repugnant to him.\n",
        "\"Blast your soul, you hussy!\" he exclaimed in exasperation. \"I'm going to take off your--\"\n",
        "He started toward her, his angry passion making him reckless, and she poised herself for a deadly thrust.\n",
        "Then came a startling interruption to a scene at once ludicrous and perilous.\n",
        "\"What's that?\"\n",
        "It was Valeria who exclaimed, but they both started violently, and Conan wheeled like a cat, his great\n",
        "sword flashing into his hand. Back in the forest had burst forth an appalling medley of screams--the\n",
        "screams of horses in terror and agony. Mingled with their screams there came the snap of splintering\n",
        "bones.\n",
        "\"Lions are slaying the horses!\" cried Valeria.\n",
        "\"Lions, nothing!\" snorted Conan, his eyes blazing. \"Did you hear a lion roar? Neither did I! Listen to those\n",
        "bones snap--not even a lion could make that much noise killing a horse.\"\n",
        "He hurried down the natural ramp and she followed, their personal feud forgotten in the adventurers'\n",
        "instinct to unite against common peril. The screams had ceased when they worked their way downward\n",
        "through the green veil of leaves that brushed the rock.\n",
        "\"I found your horse tied by the pool back there,\" he muttered, treading so noiselessly that she no longer\n",
        "wondered how he had surprised her on the crag. \"I tied mine beside it and followed the tracks of your\n",
        "boots. Watch, now!\"\n",
        "They had emerged from the belt of leaves, and stared down into the lower reaches of the forest. Above\n",
        "them the green roof spread its dusky canopy. Below them the sunlight filtered in just enough to make a\n",
        "jade-tinted twilight. The giant trunks of trees less than a hundred yards away looked dim and ghostly.\n",
        "\"The horses should be beyond that thicket, over there,\" whispered Conan, and his voice might have been\n",
        "a breeze moving through the branches. \"Listen!\"\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "403\n",
        "Valeria had already heard, and a chill crept through her veins; so she unconsciously laid her white hand\n",
        "on her companion's muscular brown arm. From beyond the thicket came the noisy crunching of bones\n",
        "and the loud rending of flesh, together with the grinding, slobbering sounds of a horrible feast.\n",
        "\"Lions wouldn't make that noise,\" whispered Conan. \"Something's eating our horses, but it's not a lion--\n",
        "Crom!\"\n",
        "The noise stopped suddenly, and Conan swore softly. A suddenly risen breeze was blowing from them\n",
        "directly toward the spot where the unseen slayer was hidden.\n",
        "\"Here it comes!\" muttered Conan, half lifting his sword.\n",
        "The thicket was violently agitated, and Valeria clutched Conan's arm hard. Ignorant of jungle lore, she yet\n",
        "knew that no animal she had ever seen could have shaken the tall brush like that.\n",
        "\"It must be as big as an elephant,\" muttered Conan, echoing her thought. \"What the devil--\" His voice\n",
        "trailed away in stunned silence.\n",
        "Through the thicket was thrust a head of nightmare and lunacy. Grinning jaws bared rows of dripping\n",
        "yellow tusks; above the yawning mouth wrinkled a saurian-like snout. Huge eyes, like those of a python\n",
        "a thousand times magnified, stared unwinkingly at the petrified humans clinging to the rock above it.\n",
        "Blood smeared the scaly, flabby lips and dripped from the huge mouth.\n",
        "The head, bigger than that of a crocodile, was further extended on a long scaled neck on which stood up\n",
        "rows of serrated spikes, and after it, crushing down the briars and saplings, waddled the body of a titan,\n",
        "a gigantic, barrel-bellied torso on absurdly short legs. The whitish belly almost raked the ground, while\n",
        "the serrated backbone rose higher than Conan could have reached on tiptoe. A long spiked tail, like that\n",
        "of a gargantuan scorpion, trailed out behind.\n",
        "\"Back up the crag, quick!\" snapped Conan, thrusting the girl behind him. \"I don't think he can climb, but\n",
        "he can stand on his hind legs and reach us--\"\n",
        "With a snapping and rending of bushes and saplings, the monster came hurtling through the thickets,\n",
        "and they fled up the rock before him like leaves blown before a wind. As Valeria plunged into the leafy\n",
        "screen a backward glance showed her the titan rearing up fearsomely on his massive hind legs, even as\n",
        "Conan had predicted. The sight sent panic racing through her. As he reared, the beast seemed more\n",
        "gigantic than ever; his snouted head towered among the trees. Then Conan's iron hand closed on her\n",
        "wrist and she was jerked headlong into the blinding welter of the leaves, and out again into the hot\n",
        "sunshine above, just as the monster fell forward with his front feet on the crag with an impact that made\n",
        "the rock vibrate.\n",
        "Behind the fugitives the huge head crashed through the twigs, and they looked down for a horrifying\n",
        "instant at the nightmare visage framed among the green leaves, eyes flaming, jaws gaping. Then the giant\n",
        "tusks clashed together futilely, and after that the head was withdrawn, vanishing from their sight as if it\n",
        "had sunk in a pool.\n",
        "Peering down through broken branches that scraped the rock, they saw it squatting on its haunches at the\n",
        "foot of the crag, staring unblinkingly up at them.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "404\n",
        "Valeria shuddered.\n",
        "\"How long do you suppose he'll crouch there?\"\n",
        "Conan kicked the skull on the leaf-strewn shelf.\n",
        "\"That fellow must have climbed up here to escape him, or one like him. He must have died of starvation.\n",
        "There are no bones broken. That thing must be a dragon, such as the black people speak of in their\n",
        "legends. If so, it won't leave here until we're both dead.\"\n",
        "Valeria looked at him blankly, her resentment forgotten. She fought down a surging of panic. She had\n",
        "proved her reckless courage a thousand times in wild battles on sea and land, on the blood-slippery decks\n",
        "of burning war ships, in the storming of walled cities, and on the trampled sandy beaches where the\n",
        "desperate men of the Red Brotherhood bathed their knives in one another's blood in their fights for\n",
        "leadership. But the prospect now confronting her congealed her blood. A cutlass stroke in the heat of\n",
        "battle was nothing; but to sit idle and helpless on a bare rock until she perished of starvation, besieged by\n",
        "a monstrous survival of an elder age--the thought sent panic throbbing through her brain.\n",
        "\"He must leave to eat and drink,\" she said helplessly.\n",
        "\"He won't have to go far to do either,\" Conan pointed out. \"He's just gorged on horse meat and, like a real\n",
        "snake, he can go for a long time without eating or drinking again. But he doesn't sleep after eating, like a\n",
        "real snake, it seems. Anyway, he can't climb this crag.\"\n",
        "Conan spoke imperturbably. He was a barbarian, and the terrible patience of the wilderness and its\n",
        "children was as much a part of him as his lusts and rages. He could endure a situation like this with a\n",
        "coolness impossible to a civilized person.\n",
        "\"Can't we get into the trees and get away, traveling like apes through the branches?\" she asked\n",
        "desperately.\n",
        "He shook his head. \"I thought of that. The branches that touch the crag down there are too light. They'd\n",
        "break with our weight. Besides, I have an idea that devil could tear up any tree around here by its roots.\"\n",
        "\"Well, are we going to sit here on our rumps until we starve, like that?\" she cried furiously, kicking the\n",
        "skull clattering across the ledge. \"I won't do it! I'll go down there and cut his damned head off--\"\n",
        "Conan had seated himself on a rocky projection at the foot of the spire. He looked up with a glint of\n",
        "admiration at her blazing eyes and tense, quivering figure, but, realizing that she was in just the mood for\n",
        "any madness, he let none of his admiration sound in his voice.\n",
        "\"Sit down,\" he grunted, catching her by her wrist and pulling her down on his knee. She was too\n",
        "surprised to resist as he took her sword from her hand and shoved it back in its sheath. \"Sit still and calm\n",
        "down. You'd only break your steel on his scales. He'd gobble you up at one gulp, or smash you like an\n",
        "egg with that spiked tail of his. We'll get out of this jam some way, but we shan't do it by getting chewed\n",
        "up and swallowed.\"\n",
        "She made no reply, nor did she seek to repulse his arm from about her waist. She was frightened, and the\n",
        "sensation was new to Valeria of the Red Brotherhood. So she sat on her companion's--or captor's--knee \n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "405\n",
        "with a docility that would have amazed Zarallo, who had anathematized her as a she-devil out of Hell's\n",
        "seraglio.\n",
        "Conan played idly with her curly yellow locks, seemingly intent only upon his conquest. Neither the\n",
        "skeleton at his feet nor the monster crouching below disturbed his mind or dulled the edge of his interest.\n",
        "The girl's restless eyes, roving the leaves below them, discovered splashes of color among the green. It\n",
        "was fruit, large, darkly crimson globes suspended from the boughs of a tree whose broad leaves were a\n",
        "peculiarly rich and vivid green. She became aware of both thirst and hunger, though thirst had not\n",
        "assailed her until she knew she could not descend from the crag to find food and water.\n",
        "\"We need not starve,\" she said. \"There is fruit we can reach.\"\n",
        "Conan glanced where she pointed.\n",
        "\"If we ate that we wouldn't need the bite of a dragon,\" he grunted. \"That's what the black people of Kush\n",
        "call the Apples of Derketa. Derketa is the Queen of the Dead. Drink a little of that juice, or spill it on your\n",
        "flesh, and you'd be dead before you could tumble to the foot of this crag.\"\n",
        "\"Oh!\"\n",
        "She lapsed into dismayed silence. There seemed no way out of their predicament, she reflected gloomily.\n",
        "She saw no way of escape, and Conan seemed to be concerned only with her supple waist and curly\n",
        "tresses. If he was trying to formulate a plan of escape, he did not show it.\n",
        "\"If you'll take your hands off me long enough to climb up on that peak,\" she said presently, \"you'll see\n",
        "something that will surprise you.\"\n",
        "He cast her a questioning glance, then obeyed with a shrug of his massive shoulders. Clinging to the\n",
        "spirelike pinnacle, he stared out over the forest roof.\n",
        "He stood a long moment in silence, posed like a bronze statue on the rock.\n",
        "\"It's a walled city, right enough,\" he muttered presently. \"Was that where you were going, when you tried\n",
        "to send me off alone to the coast?\"\n",
        "\"I saw it before you came. I knew nothing of it when I left Sukhmet.\"\n",
        "\"Who'd have thought to find a city here? I don't believe the Stygians ever penetrated this far. Could black\n",
        "people build a city like that? I see no herds on the plain, no signs of cultivation, or people moving about.\"\n",
        "\"How can you hope to see all that, at this distance?\" she demanded.\n",
        "He shrugged his shoulders and dropped down on the shelf.\n",
        "\"Well, the folk of the city can't help us just now. And they might not, if they could. The people of the\n",
        "Black Countries are generally hostile to strangers. Probably stick us full of spears--\"\n",
        "He stopped short and stood silent, as if he had forgotten what he was saying, frowning down at the\n",
        "crimson spheres gleaming among the leaves.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "406\n",
        "\"Spears!\" he muttered. \"What a blasted fool I am not to have thought of that before! That shows what a\n",
        "pretty woman does to a man's mind.\"\n",
        "\"What are you talking about?\" she inquired.\n",
        "Without answering her question, he descended to the belt of leaves and looked down through them. The\n",
        "great brute squatted below, watching the crag with the frightful patience of the reptile folk. So might one\n",
        "of his breed have glared up at their troglodyte ancestors, treed on a high-flung rock, in the dim dawn\n",
        "ages. Conan cursed him without heat, and began cutting branches, reaching out and severing them as far\n",
        "from the end as he could reach. The agitation of the leaves made the monster restless. He rose from his\n",
        "haunches and lashed his hideous tail, snapping off saplings as if they had been toothpicks. Conan\n",
        "watched him warily from the corner of his eye, and just as Valeria believed the dragon was about to hurl\n",
        "himself up the crag again, the Cimmerian drew back and climbed up to the ledge with the branches he\n",
        "had cut. There were three of these, slender shafts about seven feet long, but not larger than his thumb. He\n",
        "had also cut several strands of tough, thin vine.\n",
        "\"Branches too light for spear-hafts, and creepers no thicker than cords,\" he remarked, indicating the\n",
        "foliage about the crag. \"It won't hold our weight--but there's strength in union. That's what the\n",
        "Aquilonian renegades used to tell us Cimmerians when they came into the hills to raise an army to\n",
        "invade their own country. But we always fight by clans and tribes.\"\n",
        "\"What the devil has that got to do with those sticks?\" she demanded.\n",
        "\"You wait and see.\"\n",
        "Gathering the sticks in a compact bundle, he wedged his poniard hilt between them at one end. Then\n",
        "with the vines he bound them together and, when he had completed his task, he had a spear of no small\n",
        "strength, with a sturdy shaft seven feet in length.\n",
        "\"What good will that do?\" she demanded. \"You told me that a blade couldn't pierce his scales--\"\n",
        "\"He hasn't got scales all over him,\" answered Conan. \"There's more than one way of skinning a panther.\"\n",
        "Moving down to the edge of the leaves, he reached the spear up and carefully thrust the blade through\n",
        "one of the Apples of Derketa, drawing aside to avoid the darkly purple drops that dripped from the\n",
        "pierced fruit. Presently he withdrew the blade and showed her the blue steel stained a dull purplish\n",
        "crimson.\n",
        "\"I don't know whether it will do the job or not,\" quoth he. \"There's enough poison there to kill an elephant,\n",
        "but--well, we'll see.\"\n",
        "Valeria was close behind him as he let himself down among the leaves. Cautiously holding the poisoned\n",
        "pike away from him, he thrust his head through the branches and addressed the monster.\n",
        "\"What are you waiting down there for, you misbegotten offspring of questionable parents?\" was one of\n",
        "his more printable queries. \"Stick your ugly head up here again, you long-necked brute--or do you want\n",
        "me to come down there and kick you loose from your illegitimate spine?\"\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "407\n",
        "There was more of it--some of it crouched in eloquence that made Valeria stare, in spite of her profane\n",
        "education among the seafarers. And it had its effect on the monster. Just as the incessant yapping of a dog\n",
        "worries and enrages more constitutionally silent animals, so the clamorous voice of a man rouses fear in\n",
        "some bestial bosoms and insane rage in others. Suddenly and with appalling quickness, the mastodonic\n",
        "brute reared up on its mighty hind legs and elongated its neck and body in a furious effort to reach this\n",
        "vociferous pigmy whose clamor was disturbing the primeval silence of its ancient realm.\n",
        "But Conan had judged his distance with precision. Some five feet below him the mighty head crashed\n",
        "terribly but futilely through the leaves. And as the monstrous mouth gaped like that of a great snake,\n",
        "Conan drove his spear into the red angle of the jawbone hinge. He struck downward with all the strength\n",
        "of both arms, driving the long poniard blade to the hilt in flesh, sinew and bone.\n",
        "Instantly the jaws clashed convulsively together, severing the triple-pieced shaft and almost precipitating\n",
        "Conan from his perch. He would have fallen but for the girl behind him, who caught his sword-belt in a\n",
        "desperate grasp. He clutched at a rocky projection, and grinned his thanks back at her.\n",
        "Down on the ground the monster was wallowing like a dog with pepper in its eyes. He shook his head\n",
        "from side to side, pawed at it, and opened his mouth repeatedly to its widest extent. Presently he got a\n",
        "huge front foot on the stump of the shaft and managed to tear the blade out. Then he threw up his head,\n",
        "jaws wide and spouting blood, and glared up at the crag with such concentrated and intelligent fury that\n",
        "Valeria trembled and drew her sword. The scales along his back and flanks turned from rusty brown to a\n",
        "dull lurid red. Most horribly the monster's silence was broken. The sounds that issued from his bloodstreaming jaws did not sound like anything that could have been produced by an earthly creation.\n",
        "With harsh, grating roars, the dragon hurled himself at the crag that was the citadel of his enemies. Again\n",
        "and again his mighty head crashed upward through the branches, snapping vainly on empty air. He\n",
        "hurled his full ponderous weight against the rock until it vibrated from base to crest. And rearing upright\n",
        "he gripped it with his front legs like a man and tried to tear it up by the roots, as if it had been a tree.\n",
        "This exhibition of primordial fury chilled the blood in Valeria's veins, but Conan was too close to the\n",
        "primitive himself to feel anything but a comprehending interest. To the barbarian, no such gulf existed\n",
        "between himself and other men, and the animals, as existed in the conception of Valeria. The monster\n",
        "below them, to Conan, was merely a form of life differing from himself mainly in physical shape. He\n",
        "attributed to it characteristics similar to his own, and saw in its wrath a counterpart of his rages, in its\n",
        "roars and bellowings merely reptilian equivalents to the curses he had bestowed upon it. Feeling a\n",
        "kinship with all wild things, even dragons, it was impossible for him to experience the sick horror which\n",
        "assailed Valeria at the sight of the brute's ferocity.\n",
        "He sat watching it tranquilly, and pointed out the various changes that were taking place in its voice and\n",
        "actions.\n",
        "\"The poison's taking hold,\" he said with conviction.\n",
        "\"I don't believe it.\" To Valeria it seemed preposterous to suppose that anything, however lethal, could\n",
        "have any effect on that mountain of muscle and fury.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "408\n",
        "\"There's pain in his voice,\" declared Conan. \"First he was merely angry because of the stinging in his jaw.\n",
        "Now he feels the bite of the poison. Look! He's staggering. He'll be blind in a few more minutes. What did\n",
        "I tell you?\"\n",
        "For suddenly the dragon had lurched about and went crashing off through the bushes.\n",
        "\"Is he running away?\" inquired Valeria uneasily.\n",
        "\"He's making for the pool!\" Conan sprang up, galvanized into swift activity. \"The poison makes him\n",
        "thirsty. Come on! He'll be blind in a few moments, but he can smell his way back to the foot of the crag,\n",
        "and if our scent's here still, he'll sit there until he dies. And others of his kind may come at his cries. Let's\n",
        "go!\"\n",
        "\"Down there?\" Valeria was aghast.\n",
        "\"Sure! We'll make for the city! They may cut our heads off there, but it's our only chance. We may run\n",
        "into a thousand more dragons on the way, but it's sure death to stay here. If we wait until he dies, we\n",
        "may have a dozen more to deal with. After me, in a hurry!\"\n",
        "He went down the ramp as swiftly as an ape, pausing only to aid his less agile companion, who, until she\n",
        "saw the Cimmerian climb, had fancied herself the equal of any man in the rigging of a ship or on the\n",
        "sheer face of a cliff.\n",
        "They descended into the gloom below the branches and slid to the ground silently, though Valeria felt as\n",
        "if the pounding of her heart must surely be heard from far away. A noisy gurgling and lapping beyond\n",
        "the dense thicket indicated that the dragon was drinking at the pool.\n",
        "\"As soon as his belly is full he'll be back,\" muttered Conan. \"It may take hours for the poison to kill him--if\n",
        "it does at all.\"\n",
        "Somewhere beyond the forest the sun was sinking to the horizon. The forest was a misty twilight place of\n",
        "black shadows and dim vistas. Conan gripped Valeria's wrist and glided away from the foot of the crag.\n",
        "He made less noise than a breeze blowing among the tree trunks, but Valeria felt as if her soft boots were\n",
        "betraying their flight to all the forest.\n",
        "\"I don't think he can follow a trail,\" muttered Conan. \"But if a wind blew our body scent to him, he could\n",
        "smell us out.\"\n",
        "\"Mitra, grant that the wind blow not!\" Valeria breathed.\n",
        "Her face was a pallid oval in the gloom. She gripped her sword in her free hand, but the feel of the\n",
        "shagreen-bound hilt inspired only a feeling of helplessness in her.\n",
        "They were still some distance from the edge of the forest when they heard a snapping and crashing\n",
        "behind them. Valeria bit her lip to check a cry.\n",
        "\"He's on our trail!\" she whispered fiercely.\n",
        "Conan shook his head.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "409\n",
        "\"He didn't smell us at the rock, and he's blundering about through the forest trying to pick up our scent.\n",
        "Come on! It's the city or nothing now! He could tear down any tree we'd climb. If only the wind stays\n",
        "down--\"\n",
        "They stole on until the trees began to thin out ahead of them. Behind them the forest was a black\n",
        "impenetrable ocean of shadows. The ominous crackling still sounded behind them, as the dragon\n",
        "blundered in his erratic course.\n",
        "\"There's the plain ahead,\" breathed Valeria. \"A little more and we'll--\"\n",
        "\"Crom!\" swore Conan.\n",
        "\"Mitra!\" whispered Valeria.\n",
        "Out of the south a wind had sprung up.\n",
        "It blew over them directly into the black forest behind them. Instantly a horrible roar shook the woods.\n",
        "The aimless snapping and crackling of the bushes changed to a sustained crashing as the dragon came\n",
        "like a hurricane straight toward the spot from which the scent of his enemies was wafted.\n",
        "\"Run!\" snarled Conan, his eyes blazing like those of a trapped wolf. \"It's all we can do!\"\n",
        "Sailor's boots are not made for sprinting, and the life of a pirate does not train one for a runner. Within a\n",
        "hundred yards Valeria was panting and reeling in her gait, and behind them the crashing gave way to a\n",
        "rolling thunder as the monster broke out of the thickets and into the more open ground.\n",
        "Conan's iron arm about the woman's waist half lifted her; her feet scarcely touched the earth as she was\n",
        "borne along at a speed she could never have attained herself. If he could keep out of the beast's way for a\n",
        "bit, perhaps that betraying wind would shift--but the wind held, and a quick glance over his shoulder\n",
        "showed Conan that the monster was almost upon them, coming like a war-galley in front of a hurricane.\n",
        "He thrust Valeria from him with a force that sent her reeling a dozen feet to fall in a crumpled heap at the\n",
        "foot of the nearest tree, and the Cimmerian wheeled in the path of the thundering titan.\n",
        "Convinced that his death was upon him, the Cimmerian acted according to his instinct, and hurled\n",
        "himself full at the awful face that was bearing down on him. He leaped, slashing like a wildcat, felt his\n",
        "sword cut deep into the scales that sheathed the mighty snout--and then a terrific impact knocked him\n",
        "rolling and tumbling for fifty feet with all the wind and half the life battered out of him.\n",
        "How the stunned Cimmerian regained his feet, not even he could have ever told. But the only thought\n",
        "that filled his brain was of the woman lying dazed and helpless almost in the path of the hurtling fiend,\n",
        "and before the breath came whistling back into his gullet he was standing over her with his sword in his\n",
        "hand.\n",
        "She lay where he had thrown her, but she was struggling to a sitting posture. Neither tearing tusks nor\n",
        "trampling feet had touched her. It had been a shoulder or front leg that struck Conan, and the blind\n",
        "monster rushed on, forgetting the victims whose scent it had been following, in the sudden agony of its\n",
        "death throes. Headlong on its course it thundered until its low-hung head crashed into a gigantic tree in\n",
        "its path. The impact tore the tree up by the roots and must have dashed the brains from the misshapen \n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "410\n",
        "skull. Tree and monster fell together, and the dazed humans saw the branches and leaves shaken by the\n",
        "convulsions of the creature they covered--and then grow quiet.\n",
        "Conan lifted Valeria to her feet and together they started away at a reeling run. A few moments later they\n",
        "emerged into the still twilight of the treeless plain.\n",
        "Conan paused an instant and glanced back at the ebon fastness behind them. Not a leaf stirred, nor a bird\n",
        "chirped. It stood as silent as it must have stood before Man was created.\n",
        "\"Come on,\" muttered Conan, taking his companion's hand. \"It's touch and go now. If more dragons come\n",
        "out of the woods after us--\"\n",
        "He did not have to finish the sentence.\n",
        "The city looked very far away across the plain, farther than it had looked from the crag. Valeria's heart\n",
        "hammered until she felt as if it would strangle her. At every step she expected to hear the crashing of the\n",
        "bushes and see another colossal nightmare bearing down upon them. But nothing disturbed the silence of\n",
        "the thickets.\n",
        "With the first mile between them and the woods, Valeria breathed more easily. Her buoyant selfconfidence began to thaw out again. The sun had set and darkness was gathering over the plain,\n",
        "lightened a little by the stars that made stunted ghosts out of the cactus growths.\n",
        "\"No cattle, no plowed fields,\" muttered Conan. \"How do these people live?\"\n",
        "\"Perhaps the cattle are in pens for the night,\" suggested Valeria, \"and the fields and grazing-pastures are\n",
        "on the other side of the city.\"\n",
        "\"Maybe,\" he grunted. \"I didn't see any from the crag, though.\"\n",
        "The moon came up behind the city, etching walls and towers blackly in the yellow glow. Valeria shivered.\n",
        "Black against the moon the strange city had a somber, sinister look.\n",
        "Perhaps something of the same feeling occurred to Conan, for he stopped, glanced about him, and\n",
        "grunted: \"We'll stop here. No use coming to their gates in the night. They probably wouldn't let us in.\n",
        "Besides, we need rest, and we don't know how they'll receive us. A few hours' sleep will put us in better\n",
        "shape to fight or run.\"\n",
        "He led the way to a bed of cactus which grew in a circle--a phenomenon common to the southern desert.\n",
        "With his sword he chopped an opening, and motioned Valeria to enter.\n",
        "\"We'll be safe from the snakes here, anyhow.\"\n",
        "She glanced fearfully back toward the black line that indicated the forest some six miles away.\n",
        "\"Suppose a dragon comes out of the woods?\"\n",
        "\"We'll keep watch,\" he answered, though he made no suggestion as to what they would do in such an\n",
        "event. He was staring at the city, a few miles away. Not a light shone from spire or tower. A great black\n",
        "mass of mystery, it reared cryptically against the moonlit sky.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "411\n",
        "\"Lie down and sleep. I'll keep the first watch.\"\n",
        "She hesitated, glancing at him uncertainly, but he sat down cross-legged in the opening, facing toward\n",
        "the plain, his sword across his knees, his back to her. Without further comment she lay down on the sand\n",
        "inside the spiky circle.\n",
        "\"Wake me when the moon is at its zenith,\" she directed.\n",
        "He did not reply nor look toward her. Her last impression, as she sank into slumber, was of his muscular\n",
        "figure, immobile as a statue hewn out of bronze, outlined against the low-hanging stars.\n",
        "By\n",
        "the\n",
        "Blaze\n",
        "of\n",

        "Fire\n",
        "Jewels\n",
        "\n",
        "Valeria awoke with a start, to the realization that a grey dawn was stealing over the plain.\n",
        "She sat up, rubbing her eyes. Conan squatted beside the cactus, cutting off the thick pears and\n",
        "dexterously twitching out the spikes.\n",
        "\"You didn't awake me,\" she accused. \"You let me sleep all night!\"\n",
        "\"You were tired,\" he answered. \"Your posterior must have been sore, too, after that long ride. You pirates\n",
        "aren't used to horseback.\"\n",
        "\"What about yourself?\" she retorted.\n",
        "\"I was a kozak before I was a pirate,\" he answered. \"They live in the saddle. I snatch naps like a panther\n",
        "watching beside the trail for a deer to come by. My ears keep watch while my eyes sleep.\"\n",
        "And indeed the giant barbarian seemed as much refreshed as if he had slept the whole night on a golden\n",
        "bed. Having removed the thorns, and peeled off the tough skin, he handed the girl a thick, juicy cactus\n",
        "leaf.\n",
        "\"Skin your teeth in that pear. It's food and drink to a desert man. I was a chief of the Zuagirs once--desert\n",
        "men who live by plundering the caravans.\"\n",
        "\"Is there anything you haven't done?\" inquired the girl, half in derision and half in fascination.\n",
        "\"I've never been king of an Hyborean kingdom,\" he grinned, taking an enormous mouthful of cactus. \"But\n",
        "I've dreamed of being even that. I may be too, some day. Why shouldn't I?\"\n",
        "She shook her head in wonder at his calm audacity, and fell to devouring her pear. She found it not\n",
        "unpleasing to the palate, and full of cool and thirst-satisfying juice. Finishing his meal, Conan wiped his\n",
        "hands in the sand, rose, ran his fingers through his thick black mane, hitched up his sword belt and said:\n",
        "\"Well, let's go. If the people in that city are going to cut our throats they may as well do it now, before the\n",
        "heat of the day begins.\"\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "412\n",
        "His grim humor was unconscious, but Valeria reflected that it might be prophetic. She too hitched her\n",
        "sword belt as she rose. Her terrors of the night were past. The roaring dragons of the distant forest were\n",
        "like a dim dream. There was a swagger in her stride as she moved off beside the Cimmerian. Whatever\n",
        "perils lay ahead of them, their foes would be men. And Valeria of the Red Brotherhood had never seen\n",
        "the face of the man she feared.\n",
        "Conan glanced down at her as she strode along beside him with her swinging stride that matched his\n",
        "own.\n",
        "\"You walk more like a hillman than a sailor,\" he said. \"You must be an Aquilonian. The suns of Darfar\n",
        "never burnt your white skin brown. Many a princess would envy you.\"\n",
        "\"I am from Aquilonia,\" she replied. His compliments no longer irritated her. His evident admiration\n",
        "pleased her. For another man to have kept her watch while she slept would have angered her; she had\n",
        "always fiercely resented any man's attempting to shield or protect her because of her sex. But she found a\n",
        "secret pleasure in the fact that this man had done so. And he had not taken advantage of her fright and\n",
        "the weakness resulting from it. After all, she reflected, her companion was no common man.\n",
        "The sun rose up behind the city, turning the towers to a sinister crimson.\n",
        "\"Black last night against the moon,\" grunted Conan, his eyes clouding with the abysmal superstition of\n",
        "the barbarian. \"Blood-red as a threat of blood against the sun this dawn. I do not like this city.\"\n",
        "But they went on, and as they went Conan pointed out the fact that no road ran to the city from the north.\n",
        "\"No cattle have trampled the plain on this side of the city,\" said he. \"No plowshare has touched the earth\n",
        "for years, maybe centuries. But look: once this plain was cultivated.\"\n",
        "Valeria saw the ancient irrigation ditches he indicated, half filled in places, and overgrown with cactus.\n",
        "She frowned with perplexity as her eyes swept over the plain that stretched on all sides of the city to the\n",
        "forest edge, which marched in a vast, dim ring. Vision did not extend beyond that ring.\n",
        "She looked uneasily at the city. No helmets or spearheads gleamed on battlements, no trumpets sounded,\n",
        "no challenge rang from the towers. A silence as absolute as that of the forest brooded over the walls and\n",
        "minarets.\n",
        "The sun was high above the eastern horizon when they stood before the great gate in the northern wall,\n",
        "in the shadow of the lofty rampart. Rust flecked the iron bracings of the mighty bronze portal.\n",
        "Spiderwebs glistened thickly on hinge and sill and bolted panel.\n",
        "\"It hasn't been opened for years!\" exclaimed Valeria.\n",
        "\"A dead city,\" grunted Conan. \"That's why the ditches were broken and the plain untouched.\"\n",
        "\"But who built it? Who dwelt here? Where did they go? Why did they abandon it?\"\n",
        "\"Who can say? Maybe an exiled clan of Stygians built it. Maybe not. It doesn't look like Stygian\n",
        "architecture. Maybe the people were wiped out by enemies, or a plague exterminated them.\"\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "413\n",
        "\"In that case their treasures may still be gathering dust and cobwebs in there,\" suggested Valeria, the\n",
        "acquisitive instincts of her profession waking in her; prodded, too, by feminine curiosity. \"Can we open\n",
        "the gate? Let's go in and explore a bit.\"\n",
        "Conan eyed the heavy portal dubiously, but placed his massive shoulder against it and thrust with all the\n",
        "power of his muscular calves and thighs. With a rasping screech of rusty hinges the gate moved\n",
        "ponderously inward, and Conan straightened and drew his sword. Valeria stared over his shoulder, and\n",
        "made a sound indicative of surprise.\n",
        "They were not looking into an open street or court as one would have expected. The opened gate, or door,\n",
        "gave directly into a long, broad hall which ran away and away until its vista grew indistinct in the\n",
        "distance. It was of heroic proportions, and the floor of a curious red stone, cut in square tiles, that seemed\n",
        "to smolder as if with the reflection of flames. The walls were of a shiny green material.\n",
        "\"Jade, or I'm a Shemite!\" swore Conan.\n",
        "\"Not in such quantity!\" protested Valeria.\n",
        "\"I've looted enough from the Khitan caravans to know what I'm talking about,\" he asserted. \"That's jade!\"\n",
        "The vaulted ceiling was of lapis lazuli, adorned with clusters of great green stones that gleamed with a\n",
        "poisonous radiance.\n",
        "\"Green fire-stones,\" growled Conan. \"That's what the people of Punt call them. They're supposed to be the\n",
        "petrified eyes of those prehistoric snakes the ancients called Golden Serpents. They glow like a cat's eyes\n",
        "in the dark. At night this hall would be lighted by them, but it would be a hellishly weird illumination.\n",
        "Let's look around. We might find a cache of jewels.\"\n",
        "\"Shut the door,\" advised Valeria. \"I'd hate to have to outrun a dragon down this hall.\"\n",
        "Conan grinned, and replied: \"I don't believe the dragons ever leave the forest.\"\n",
        "But he complied, and pointed out the broken bolt on the inner side.\n",
        "\"I thought I heard something snap when I shoved against it. That bolt's freshly broken. Rust has eaten\n",
        "nearly through it. If the people ran away, why should it have been bolted on the inside?\"\n",
        "\"They undoubtedly left by another door,\" suggested Valeria.\n",
        "She wondered how many centuries had passed since the light of outer day had filtered into that great hall\n",
        "through the open door. Sunlight was finding its way somehow into the hall, and they quickly saw the\n",
        "source. High up in the vaulted ceiling skylights were set in slot-like openings--translucent sheets of some\n",
        "crystalline substance. In the splotches of shadow between them, the green jewels winked like the eyes of\n",
        "angry cats. Beneath their feet the dully lurid floor smoldered with changing hues and colors of flame. It\n",
        "was like treading the floors of Hell with evil stars blinking overhead.\n",
        "Three balustraded galleries ran along on each side of the hall, one above the other.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "414\n",
        "\"A four-storied house,\" grunted Conan, \"and this hall extends to the roof. It's long as a street. I seem to see\n",
        "a door at the other end.\"\n",
        "Valeria shrugged her white shoulders.\n",
        "\"Your eyes are better than mine, then, though I'm accounted sharp-eyed among the sea-rovers.\"\n",
        "They turned into an open door at random, and traversed a series of empty chambers, floored like the hall,\n",
        "and with walls of the same green jade, or of marble or ivory or chalcedony, adorned with friezes of\n",
        "bronze, gold, or silver. In the ceilings the green fire-gems were set, and their light was as ghostly and\n",
        "illusive as Conan had predicted. Under the witch-fire glow the intruders moved like specters.\n",
        "Some of the chambers lacked this illumination, and their doorways showed black as the mouth of the Pit.\n",
        "These Conan and Valeria avoided, keeping always to the lighted chambers.\n",
        "Cobwebs hung in the corners, but there was no perceptible accumulation of dust on the floor, or on the\n",
        "tables and seats of marble, jade, or carnelian which occupied the chambers. Here and there were rugs of\n",
        "that silk known as Khitan which is practically indestructible. Nowhere did they find any windows, or\n",
        "doors opening into streets or courts. Each door merely opened into another chamber or hall.\n",
        "\"Why don't we come to a street?\" grumbled Valeria. \"This palace or whatever we're in must be as big as\n",
        "the king of Turan's seraglio.\"\n",
        "\"They must not have perished of plague,\" sad Conan, meditating upon the mystery of the empty city.\n",
        "\"Otherwise we'd find skeletons. Maybe it became haunted, and everybody got up and left. Maybe--\"\n",
        "\"Maybe, hell!\" broke in Valeria rudely. \"We'll never know. Look at these friezes. They portray men. What\n",
        "race do they belong to?\"\n",
        "Conan scanned them and shook his head.\n",
        "\"I never saw people exactly like them. But there's the smack of the East about them--Vendhya, maybe, or\n",
        "Kosala.\"\n",
        "\"Were you a king in Kosala?\" she asked, masking her keen curiosity with derision.\n",
        "\"No. But I was a war chief of the Afghulis who live in the Himelian mountains above the borders of\n",
        "Vendhya. These people favor the Kosalans. But why should Kosalans be building a city this far to the\n",
        "west?\"\n",
        "The figures portrayed were those of slender, olive-skinned men and women, with finely chiseled, exotic\n",
        "features. They wore filmy robes and many delicate jeweled ornaments, and were depicted mostly in\n",
        "attitudes of feasting, dancing, or lovemaking.\n",
        "\"Easterners, all right,\" grunted Conan, \"but from where I don't know. They must have lived a\n",
        "disgustingly peaceful life, though, or they'd have scenes of wars and fights. Let's go up those stairs.\"\n",
        "It was an ivory spiral that wound up from the chamber in which they were standing. They mounted three\n",
        "flights and came into a broad chamber on the fourth floor, which seemed to be the highest tier in the \n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "415\n",
        "building. Skylights in the ceiling illuminated the room, in which light the fire-gems winked pallidly.\n",
        "Glancing through the doors they saw, except on one side, a series of similarly lighted chambers. This\n",
        "other door opened upon a balustraded gallery that overhung a hall much smaller than the one they had\n",
        "recently explored on the lower floor.\n",
        "\"Hell!\" Valeria sat down disgustedly on a jade bench. \"The people who deserted this city must have taken\n",
        "all their treasures with them. I'm tired of wandering through these bare rooms at random.\"\n",
        "\"All these upper chambers seem to be lighted,\" said Conan. \"I wish we could find a window that\n",
        "overlooked the city. Let's have a look through that door over there.\"\n",
        "\"You have a look,\" advised Valeria. \"I'm going to sit here and rest my feet.\"\n",
        "Conan disappeared through the door opposite that one opening upon the gallery, and Valeria leaned\n",
        "back with her hands clasped behind her head, and thrust her booted legs out in front of her. These silent\n",
        "rooms and halls with their gleaming green clusters of ornaments and burning crimson floors were\n",
        "beginning to depress her. She wished they could find their way out of the maze into which they had\n",
        "wandered and emerge into a street. She wondered idly what furtive, dark feet had glided over those\n",
        "flaming floors in past centuries, how many deeds of cruelty and mystery those winking ceiling-gems had\n",
        "blazed down upon.\n",
        "It was a faint noise that brought her out of her reflections. She was on her feet with her sword in her hand\n",
        "before she realized what had disturbed her. Conan had not returned, and she knew it was not he that she\n",
        "had heard.\n",
        "The sound had come from somewhere beyond the door that opened on to the gallery. Soundlessly in her\n",
        "soft leather boots she glided through it, crept across the balcony and peered down between the heavy\n",
        "balustrades.\n",
        "A man was stealing along the hall.\n",
        "The sight of a human being in this supposedly deserted city was a startling shock. Crouching down\n",
        "behind the stone balusters, with every nerve tingling, Valeria glared down at the stealthy figure.\n",
        "The man in no way resembled the figures depicted on the friezes. He was slightly above middle height,\n",
        "very dark, though not Negroid. He was naked but for a scanty silk clout that only partly covered his\n",
        "muscular hips, and a leather girdle, a hand's breadth broad, about his lean waist. His long black hair\n",
        "hung in lank strands about his shoulders, giving him a wild appearance. He was gaunt, but knots and\n",
        "cords of muscles stood out on his arms and legs, without that fleshy padding that presents a pleasing\n",
        "symmetry of contour. He was built with an economy that was almost repellent.\n",
        "Yet it was not so much his physical appearance as his attitude that impressed the woman who watched\n",
        "him. He slunk along, stooped in a semi-crouch, his head turning from side to side. He grasped a widetipped blade in his right hand and she saw it shake with the intensity of the emotion that gripped him.\n",
        "He was afraid, trembling in the grip of some dire terror. When he turned his head she caught the blaze of\n",
        "wild eyes among the lank strands of black hair.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "416\n",
        "He did not see her. On tiptoe he glided across the hall and vanished through an open door. A moment\n",
        "later she heard a choking cry, and then silence fell again.\n",
        "Consumed with curiosity, Valeria glided along the gallery until she came to a door above the one through\n",
        "which the man had passed. It opened into another, smaller gallery that encircled a large chamber.\n",
        "This chamber was on the third floor, and its ceiling was not so high as that of the hall. It was lighted only\n",
        "by the fire-stones, and their weird green glow left the spaces under the balcony in shadows.\n",
        "Valeria's eyes widened. The man she had seen was still in the chamber.\n",
        "He lay face down on a dark crimson carpet in the middle of the room. His body was limp, his arms\n",
        "spread wide. His curved sword lay near him.\n",
        "She wondered why he should lie there so motionless. Then her eyes narrowed as she stared down at the\n",
        "rug on which he lay. Beneath and about him the fabric showed a slightly different color, a deeper,\n",
        "brighter crimson.\n",
        "Shivering slightly, she crouched down closer behind the balustrade, intently scanning the shadows under\n",
        "the overhanging gallery. They gave up no secret.\n",
        "Suddenly another figure entered the grim drama. He was a man similar to the first, and he came in by a\n",
        "door opposite that which gave upon the hall.\n",
        "His eyes glared at the sight of the man on the floor, and he spoke something in a staccato voice that\n",
        "sounded like \"Chicmec!\" The other did not move.\n",
        "The man stepped quickly across the floor, bent, gripped the fallen man's shoulder and turned him over. A\n",
        "choking cry escaped him as the head fell back limply, disclosing a throat that had been severed from ear\n",
        "to ear.\n",
        "The man let the corpse fall back upon the blood-stained carpet, and sprang to his feet, shaking like a\n",
        "windblown leaf. His face was an ashy mask of fear. But with one knee flexed for flight, he froze suddenly,\n",
        "became as immobile as an image, staring across the chamber with dilated eyes.\n",
        "In the shadows beneath the balcony a ghostly light began to glow and grow, a light that was not part of\n",
        "the fire-stone gleam. Valeria felt her hair stir as she watched it; for, dimly visible in the throbbing\n",
        "radiance, there floated a human skull, and it was from this skull--human yet appallingly misshapen--that\n",
        "the spectral light seemed to emanate. It hung there like a disembodied head, conjured out of night and\n",
        "the shadows, growing more and more distinct; human, and yet not human as she knew humanity.\n",
        "The man stood motionless, an embodiment of paralyzed horror, staring fixedly at the apparition. The\n",
        "thing moved out from the wall and a grotesque shadows moved with it. Slowly the shadow became\n",
        "visible as a man-like figure whose naked torso and limbs shone whitely, with the hue of bleached bones.\n",
        "The bare skull on its shoulders grinned eyelessly, in the midst of its unholy nimbus, and the man\n",
        "confronting it seemed unable to take his eyes from it. He stood still, his sword dangling from nerveless\n",
        "fingers, on his face the expression of a man bound by the spells of a mesmerist.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "417\n",
        "Valeria realized that it was not fear alone that paralyzed him. Some hellish quality of that throbbing glow\n",
        "had robbed him of his power to think and act. She herself, safely above the scene, felt the subtle impact of\n",
        "a nameless emanation that was a threat to sanity.\n",
        "The horror swept toward its victim and he moved at last, but only to drop his sword and sink to his knees,\n",
        "covering his eyes with his hands. Dumbly he awaited the stroke of the blade that now gleamed in the\n",
        "apparition's hand as it reared above him like Death triumphant over mankind.\n",
        "Valeria acted according to the first impulse of her wayward nature. With one tigerish movement she was\n",
        "over the balustrade and dropping to the floor behind the awful shape. It wheeled at the thud of her soft\n",
        "boots on the floor, but even as it turned, her keen blade lashed down and a fierce exultation swept her as\n",
        "she felt the edge cleave solid flesh and mortal bone.\n",
        "The apparition cried out gurglingly and went down, severed through the shoulder, breastbone and spine,\n",
        "and as it fell the burning skull rolled clear, revealing a lank mop of black hair and a dark face twisted in\n",
        "the convulsions of death. Beneath the horrific masquerade there was a human being, a man similar to the\n",
        "one kneeling supinely on the floor.\n",
        "The latter looked up at the sound of the blow and the cry, and now he glared in wild-eyed amazement at\n",
        "the whiteskinned woman who stood over the corpse with a dripping sword in her hand.\n",
        "He staggered up, yammering as if the sight had almost unseated his reason. She was amazed to realize\n",
        "that she understood him. He was gibbering in the Stygian tongue, though in a dialect unfamiliar to her.\n",
        "\"Who are you? Whence come you? What do you in Xuchotl?\" Then rushing on, without waiting for her to\n",
        "reply: \"But you are a friend--goddess or devil, it makes no difference! You have slain the Burning Skull! It\n",
        "was but a man beneath it, after all! We deemed it a demon they conjured up out of the catacombs! Listen!\"\n",
        "He stopped short in his ravings and stiffened, straining his ears with painful intensity. The girl heard\n",
        "nothing.\n",
        "\"We must hasten!\" he whispered. \"They are west of the Great Hall! They may be all around us here! They\n",
        "may be creeping upon us even now!\"\n",
        "He seized her wrist in a convulsive grasp she found hard to break.\n",
        "\"Whom do you mean by 'they'?\" she demanded.\n",
        "He stared at her uncomprehendingly for an instant, as if he found her ignorance hard to understand.\n",
        "\"They?\" he stammered vaguely. \"Why--why, the people of Xotalanc! The clan of the man you slew. They\n",
        "who dwell by the eastern gate.\"\n",
        "\"You mean to say this city is inhabited?\" she exclaimed.\n",
        "\"Aye! Aye!\" He was writhing in the impatience of apprehension. \"Come away! Come quick! We must\n",
        "return to Tecuhltli!\"\n",
        "\"Where is that?\" she demanded.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "418\n",
        "\"The quarter by the western gate!\" He had her wrist again and was pulling her toward the door through\n",
        "which he had first come. Great beads of perspiration dripped from his dark forehead, and his eyes blazed\n",
        "with terror.\n",
        "\"Wait a minute!\" she growled, flinging off his hand. \"Keep your hands off me, or I'll split your skull.\n",
        "What's all this about? Who are you? Where would you take me?\"\n",
        "He took a firm grip on himself, casting glances to all sides, and began speaking so fast his words tripped\n",
        "over each other.\n",
        "\"My name is Techotl. I am of Techultli. I and this man who lies with his throat cut came into the Halls of\n",
        "Silence to try and ambush some of the Xotalancas. But we became separated and I returned here to find\n",
        "him with his gullet slit. The Burning Skull did it, I know, just as he would have slain me had you not\n",
        "killed him. But perhaps he was not alone. Others may be stealing from Xotalanc! The gods themselves\n",
        "blench at the fate of those they take alive!\"\n",
        "At the thought he shook as with an ague and his dark skin grew ashy. Valeria frowned puzzledly at him.\n",
        "She sensed intelligence behind this rigmarole, but it was meaningless to her.\n",
        "She turned toward the skull, which still glowed and pulsed on the floor, and was reaching a booted toe\n",
        "tentatively toward it, when the man who called himself Techotl sprang forward with a cry.\n",
        "\"Do not touch it! Do not even look at it! Madness and death lurk in it. The wizards of Xotalanc\n",
        "understand its secret--they found it in the catacombs, where lie the bones of terrible kings who ruled in\n",
        "Xuchotl in the black centuries of the past. To gaze upon it freezes the blood and withers the brain of a\n",
        "man who understands not its mystery. To touch it causes madness and destruction.\"\n",
        "She scowled at him uncertainly. He was not a reassuring figure, with his lean, muscle-knotted frame, and\n",
        "snaky locks. In his eyes, behind the glow of terror, lurked a weird light she had never seen in the eyes of a\n",
        "man wholly sane. Yet he seemed sincere in his protestations.\n",
        "\"Come!\" he begged, reaching for her hand, and then recoiling as he remembered her warning. \"You are a\n",
        "stranger. How you came here I do not know, but if you were a goddess or a demon, come to aid Tecuhltli,\n",
        "you would know all the things you have asked me. You must be from beyond the great forest, whence\n",
        "our ancestors came. But you are our friend, or you would not have slain my enemy. Come quickly, before\n",
        "the Xotalancas find us and slay us!\"\n",
        "From his repellent, impassioned face she glanced to the sinister skull, smoldering and glowing on the\n",
        "floor near the dead man. It was like a skull seen in a dream, undeniably human, yet with disturbing\n",
        "distortions and malformations of contour and outline. In life the wearer of that skull must have presented\n",
        "an alien and monstrous aspect. Life? It seemed to possess some sort of life of its own. Its jaws yawned at\n",
        "her and snapped together. Its radiance grew brighter, more vivid, yet the impression of nightmare grew\n",
        "too; it was a dream; all life was a dream--it was Techotl's urgent voice which snapped Valeria back from\n",
        "the dim gulfs whither she was drifting.\n",
        "\"Do not look at the skull! Do not look at the skull!\" It was a far cry from across unreckoned voids.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "419\n",
        "Valeria shook herself like a lion shaking his mane. Her vision cleared. Techotl was chattering: \"In life it\n",
        "housed the awful brain of a king of magicians! It holds still the life and fire of magic drawn from outer\n",
        "spaces!\"\n",
        "With a curse Valeria leaped, lithe as a panther, and the skull crashed to flaming bits under her swinging\n",
        "sword. Somewhere in the room, or in the void, or in the dim reaches of her consciousness, an inhuman\n",
        "voice cried out in pain and rage.\n",
        "Techotl's hand was plucking at her arm and he was gibbering: \"You have broken it! You have destroyed it!\n",
        "Not all the black arts of Xotalanc can rebuild it! Come away! Come away quickly, now!\"\n",
        "\"But I can't go,\" she protested. \"I have a friend somewhere near by--\"\n",
        "The flare of his eyes cut her short as he stared past her with an expression grown ghastly. She wheeled\n",
        "just as four men rushed through as many doors, converging on the pair in the center of the chamber.\n",
        "They were like the others she had seen, the same knotted muscles bulging on otherwise gaunt limbs, the\n",
        "same lank blue-black hair, the same mad glare in their wild eyes. They were armed and clad like Techotl,\n",
        "but on the breast of each was painted a white skull.\n",
        "There were no challenges or war cries. Like blood-mad tigers the men of Xotalanc sprang at the throats of\n",
        "their enemies. Techotl met them with the fury of desperation, ducked the swipe of a wide-headed blade,\n",
        "and grappled with the wielder, and bore him to the floor where they rolled and wrestled in murderous\n",
        "silence.\n",
        "The other three swarmed on Valeria, their weird eyes red as the eyes of mad dogs.\n",
        "She killed the first who came within reach before he could strike a blow, her long straight blade splitting\n",
        "his skull even as his own sword lifted for a stroke. She side-stepped a thrust, even as she parried a slash.\n",
        "Her eyes danced and her lips smiled without mercy. Again she was Valeria of the Red Brotherhood, and\n",
        "the hum of her steel was like a bridal song in her ears.\n",
        "Her sword darted past a blade that sought to parry, and sheathed six inches of its point in a leatherguarded midriff. The man gasped agonizedly and went to his knees, but his tall mate lunged in, in\n",
        "ferocious silence, raining blow on blow so furiously that Valeria had no opportunity to counter. She\n",
        "stepped back coolly, parrying the strokes and watching for her chance to thrust home. He could not long\n",
        "keep up that flailing whirlwind. His arm would tire, his wind would fail; he would weaken, falter, and\n",
        "then her blade would slide smoothly into his heart. A sidelong glance showed her Techotl kneeling on the\n",
        "breast of his antagonist and striving to break the other's hold on his wrist and to drive home a dagger.\n",
        "Sweat beaded the forehead of the man facing her, and his eyes were like burning coals. Smite as he would,\n",
        "he could not break past nor beat down her guard. His breath came in gusty gulps, his blows began to fall\n",
        "erratically. She stepped back to draw him out--and felt her thighs locked in an iron grip. She had\n",
        "forgotten the wounded man on the floor.\n",
        "Crouching on his knees, he held her with both arms locked about her legs, and his mate croaked in\n",
        "triumph and began working his way around to come at her from the left side. Valeria wrenched and tore\n",
        "savagely, but in vain. She could free herself of this clinging menace with a downward flick of her sword, \n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "420\n",
        "but in that instant the curved blade of the tall warrior would crash through her skull. The wounded man\n",
        "began to worry at her bare thigh with his teeth like a wild beast.\n",
        "She reached down with her left hand and gripped his long hair, forcing his head back so that his white\n",
        "teeth and rolling eyes gleamed up at her. The tall Xotalanc cried out fiercely and leaped in, smiting with\n",
        "all the fury of his arm. Awkwardly she parried the stroke, and it beat the flat of her blade down on her\n",
        "head so that she saw sparks flash before her eyes, and staggered. Up went the sword again, with a low,\n",
        "beast-like cry of triumph--and then a giant form loomed behind the Xotalanc and steel flashed like a jet of\n",
        "blue lightning. The cry of the warrior broke short and he went down like an ox beneath the pole-ax, his\n",
        "brains gushing from his skull that had been split to the throat.\n",
        "\"Conan!\" gasped Valeria. In a gust of passion she turned on the Xotalanc whose long hair she still gripped\n",
        "in her left hand. \"Dog of Hell!\" Her blade swished as it cut the air in an upswinging arc with a blur in the\n",
        "middle, and the headless body slumped down, spurting blood. She hurled the severed head across the\n",
        "room.\n",
        "\"What the devil's going on here?\" Conan bestrode the corpse of the man he had killed, broadsword in\n",
        "hand, glaring about him in amazement.\n",
        "Techotl was rising from the twitching figure of the last Xotalanc, shaking red drops from his dagger. He\n",
        "was bleeding from the stab deep in the thigh. He stared at Conan with dilated eyes.\n",
        "\"What is all this?\" Conan demanded again, not yet recovered from the stunning surprise of finding\n",
        "Valeria engaged in a savage battle with this fantastic figures in a city he had thought empty and\n",
        "uninhabited. Returning from an aimless exploration of the upper chambers to find Valeria missing from\n",
        "the room where he had left her, he had followed the sounds of strife that burst on his dumfounded ears.\n",
        "\"Five dead dogs!\" exclaimed Techotl, his flaming eyes reflecting a ghastly exultation. \"Five slain! Five\n",
        "crimson nails for the black pillar! The gods of blood be thanked!\"\n",
        "He lifted quivering hands on high, and then, with the face of a fiend, he spat on the corpses and stamped\n",
        "on their faces, dancing in his ghoulish glee. His recent allies eyed him in amazement, and Conan asked, in\n",
        "the Aquilonian tongue: \"Who is this madman?\"\n",
        "Valeria shrugged her shoulders.\n",
        "\"He says his name's Techotl. From his babblings I gather that his people live at one end of this crazy city,\n",
        "and these others at the other end. Maybe we'd better go with him. He seems friendly, and it's easy to see\n",
        "that the other clan isn't.\"\n",
        "Techotl had ceased his dancing and was listening again, his head tilted sidewise, dog-like, triumph\n",
        "struggling with fear in his repellent countenance.\n",
        "\"Come away, now!\" he whispered. \"We have done enough! Five dead dogs! My people will welcome you!\n",
        "They will honor you! But come! It is far to Tecuhltli. At any moment the Xotalancs may come on us in\n",
        "numbers too great even for your swords.\"\n",
        "\"Lead the way,\" grunted Conan.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "421\n",
        "Techotl instantly mounted a stair leading up to the gallery, beckoning them to follow him, which they did,\n",
        "moving rapidly to keep on his heels. Having reached the gallery, he plunged into a door that opened\n",
        "toward the west, and hurried through chamber after chamber, each lighted by skylights or green firejewels.\n",
        "\"What sort of place can this be?\" muttered Valeria under her breath.\n",
        "\"Crom knows!\" answered Conan. \"I've seen his kind before, though. They live on the shores of Lake Zuad,\n",
        "near the border of Kush. They're a sort of mongrel Stygians, mixed with another race that wandered into\n",
        "Stygia from the east some centuries ago and were absorbed by them. They're called Tlazitlans. I'm willing\n",
        "to bet it wasn't they who built this city, though.\"\n",
        "Techotl's fear did not seem to diminish as they drew away from the chamber where the dead men lay. He\n",
        "kept twisting his head on his shoulder to listen for sounds of pursuit, and stared with burning intensity\n",
        "into every doorway they passed.\n",
        "Valeria shivered in spite of herself. She feared no man. But the weird floor beneath her feet, the uncanny\n",
        "jewels over her head, dividing the lurking shadows among them, the stealth and terror of their guide,\n",
        "impressed her with a nameless apprehension, a sensation of lurking, inhuman peril.\n",
        "\"They may be between us and Tecuhltli!\" he whispered once. \"We must beware lest they be lying in wait!\"\n",
        "\"Why don't we get out of this infernal palace, and take to the streets?\" demanded Valeria.\n",
        "\"There are no streets in Xuchotl,\" he answered. \"No squares nor open courts. The whole city is built like\n",
        "one giant palace under one great roof. The nearest approach to a street is the Great Hall which traverses\n",
        "the city from the north gate to the south gate. The only doors opening into the outer world are the city\n",
        "gates, through which no living man has passed for fifty years.\"\n",
        "\"How long have you dwelt here?\" asked Conan.\n",
        "\"I was born in the castle of Tecuhltli thirty-five years ago. I have never set foot outside the city. For the\n",
        "love of the gods, let us go silently! These halls may be full of lurking devils. Olmec shall tell you all when\n",
        "we reach Tecuhltli.\"\n",
        "So in silence they glided on with the green fire-stones blinking overhead and the flaming floors\n",
        "smoldering under their feet, and it seemed to Valeria as if they fled through Hell, guided by a dark-faced\n",
        "lank-haired goblin.\n",
        "Yet it was Conan who halted them as they were crossing an unusually wide chamber. His wildernessbred ears were keener even than the ears of Techotl, whetted though his were by a lifetime of warfare in\n",
        "this silent corridors.\n",
        "\"You think some of your enemies may be ahead of us, lying in ambush?\"\n",
        "\"They prowl through these rooms at all hours,\" answered Techotl, \"as do we. The halls and chambers\n",
        "between Tecuhltli and Xotalanc are a disputed region, owned by no man. We call it the Halls of Silence.\n",
        "Why do you ask?\"\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "422\n",
        "\"Because men are in the chambers ahead of us,\" answered Conan. \"I heard steel clink against stone.\"\n",
        "Again a shaking seized Techotl, and he clenched his teeth to keep them from chattering.\n",
        "\"Perhaps they are your friends,\" suggested Valeria.\n",
        "\"We dare not chance it,\" he panted, and moved with frenzied activity. He turned aside and glided\n",
        "through a doorway on the left which led into a chamber from which an ivory staircase wound down into\n",
        "darkness.\n",
        "\"This leads to an unlighted corridor below us!\" he hissed, great beads of perspiration standing out on his\n",
        "brow. \"They may be lurking there, too. It may all be a trick to draw us into it. But we must take the\n",
        "chance that they have laid their ambush in the rooms above. Come swiftly now!\"\n",
        "Softly as phantoms they descended the stair and came to the mouth of a corridor black as night. They\n",
        "crouched there for a moment, listening, and then melted into it. As they moved along, Valeria's flesh\n",
        "crawled between her shoulders in momentary expectation of a sword-thrust in the dark. But for Conan's\n",
        "iron fingers gripping her arm she had no physical cognizance of her companions. Neither made as much\n",
        "noise as a cat would have made. The darkness was absolute. One hand, outstretched, touched a wall, and\n",
        "occasionally she felt a door under her fingers. The hallway seemed interminable.\n",
        "Suddenly they were galvanized by a sound behind them. Valeria's flesh crawled anew, for she recognized\n",
        "it as the soft opening of a door. Men had come into the corridor behind them. Even with the thought she\n",
        "stumbled over something that felt like a human skull. It rolled across the floor with an appalling clatter.\n",
        "\"Run!\" yelped Techotl, a note of hysteria in his voice, and was away down the corridor like a flying ghost.\n",
        "Again Valeria felt Conan's hand bearing her up and sweeping her along as they raced after their guide.\n",
        "Conan could see in the dark no better than she, but he possessed a sort of instinct that made his course\n",
        "unerring. Without his support and guidance she would have fallen or stumbled against the wall. Down\n",
        "the corridor they sped, while the swift patter of flying feet drew closer and closer, and then suddenly\n",
        "Techotl panted: \"Here is the stair! After me, quick! Oh, quick!\"\n",
        "His hand came out of the dark and caught Valeria's wrist as she stumbled blindly on the steps. She felt\n",
        "herself half dragged, half lifted up the winding stair, while Conan released her and turned on the steps,\n",
        "his ears and instincts telling him their foes were hard at their backs. And the sounds were not all those of\n",
        "human feet.\n",
        "Something came writhing up the steps, something that slithered and rustled and brought a chill in the air\n",
        "with it. Conan lashed down with his great sword and felt the blade shear through something that might\n",

        "the touch of frost, and then the darkness beneath him was disturbed by a frightful thrashing and lashing,\n",
        "and a man cried out in agony.\n",
        "The next moment Conan was racing up the winding staircase, and through a door that stood open at the\n",
        "head.\n",
        "Valeria and Techotl were already through, and Techotl slammed the door and shot a bolt across it--the\n",
        "first Conan had seen since they had left the outer gate.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "423\n",
        "Then he turned and ran across the well-lighted chamber into which they had come, and as they passed\n",
        "through the farther door, Conan glanced back and saw the door groaning and straining under heavy\n",
        "pressure violently applied from the other side.\n",
        "Though Techotl did not abate either his speed or his caution, he seemed more confident now. He had the\n",
        "air of a man who had come into familiar territory, within call of friends.\n",
        "But Conan renewed his terror by asking: \"What was that thing I fought on the stairs?\"\n",
        "\"The men of Xotalanc,\" answered Techotl, without looking back. \"I told you the halls were full of them.\"\n",
        "\"This wasn't a man,\" grunted Conan. \"It was something that crawled, and it was as cold as ice to the touch.\n",
        "I think I cut it asunder. It fell back on the men who were following us, and must have killed one of them\n",
        "in its death throes.\"\n",
        "Techotl's head jerked back, his face ashy again. Convulsively he quickened his pace.\n",
        "\"It was the Crawler! A monster they have brought out of the catacombs to aid them! What it is, we do not\n",
        "know, but we have found our people hideously slain by it. In Set's name, hasten! If they put it on our trail,\n",
        "it will follow us to the very doors of Tecuhltli!\"\n",
        "\"I doubt it,\" grunted Conan. \"That was a shrewd cut I dealt it on the stair.\"\n",
        "\"Hasten! Hasten!\" groaned Techotl.\n",
        "They ran through a series of green-lit chambers, traversed a broad hall, and halted before a giant bronze\n",

        "\"Men have been smitten down before this door, when they thought they were safe,\" he said.\n",
        "\"Why don't they open the door?\" asked Conan.\n",
        "\"They are looking at us through the Eye,\" answered Techotl. \"They are puzzled at the sight of you.\" He\n",
        "lifted his voice and called: \"Open the door, Excelan! It is I, Techotl, with friends from the great world\n",
        "beyond the forest!--They will open,\" he assured his allies.\n",
        "\"They'd better do it in a hurry, then,\" said Conan grimly. \"I hear something crawling along the floor\n",

        "424\n",
        "Techotl went ashy again and attacked the door with his fists, screaming: \"Open, you fools, open! The\n",
        "Crawler is at our heels!\"\n",
        "Even as he beat and shouted, the great bronze door swung noiselessly back, revealing a heavy chain\n",
        "across the entrance, over which spearheads bristled and fierce countenances regarded them intently for\n",
        "an instant. Then the chain was dropped and Techotl grasped the arms of his friends in a nervous frenzy\n",
        "and fairly dragged them over the threshold. A glance over his shoulder just as the door was closing\n",
        "showed Conan the long dim vista of the hall, and dimly framed at the other end an ophidian shape that\n",
        "writhed slowly and painfully into view, flowing in a dull-hued length from a chamber door, its hideous\n",
        "bloodstained head wagging drunkenly. Then the closing door shut off the view.\n",
        "Inside the square chamber into which they had come heavy bolts were drawn across the door, and the\n",
        "chain locked into place. The door was made to stand the battering of a siege. Four men stood on guard, of\n",
        "the same lank-haired, dark-skinned breed as Techotl, with spears in their hands and swords at their hips.\n",
        "In the wall near the door there was a complicated contrivance of mirrors which Conan guessed was the\n",
        "Eye Techotl had mentioned, so arranged that a narrow, crystal-paned slot in the wall could be looked\n",
        "through from within without being discernible from without. The four guardsmen stared at the strangers\n",
        "with wonder, but asked no question, nor did Techotl vouchsafe any information. He moved with easy\n",
        "confidence now, as if he had shed his cloak of indecision and fear the instant he crossed the threshold.\n",
        "\"Come!\" he urged his new-found friends, but Conan glanced toward the door.\n",
        "\"What about those fellows who were following us? Won't they try to storm that door?\"\n",
        "Techotl shook his head.\n",
        "\"They know they cannot break down the Door of the Eagle. They will flee back to Xotalanc, with their\n",
        "crawling fiend. Come! I will take you to the rulers of Tecuhltli.\"\n",
        "One of the four guards opened the door opposite the one by which they had entered, and they passed\n",
        "through into a hallway which, like most of the rooms on that level, was lighted by both the slot-like\n",
        "skylights and the clusters of winking fire-gems. But unlike the other rooms they had traversed, this hall\n",
        "showed evidences of occupation. Velvet tapestries adorned the glossy jade walls, rich rugs were on the\n",
        "crimson floors, and the ivory seats, benches and divans were littered with satin cushions.\n",
        "The hall ended in an ornate door, before which stood no guard. Without ceremony Techotl thrust the\n",
        "door open and ushered his friends into a broad chamber, where some thirty dark-skinned men and\n",
        "women lounged on satin-covered couches sprang up with exclamations of amazement.\n",
        "The men, all except one, were of the same type as Techotl, and the women were equally dark and strangeeyed, though not unbeautiful in a weird dark way. They wore sandals, golden breastplates, and scanty\n",
        "silk skirts supported by gem-crusted girdles, and their black manes, cut square at their naked shoulders,\n",
        "were bound with silver circlets.\n",
        "On a wide ivory seat on a jade dais sat a man and a woman who differed subtly from the others. He was\n",
        "a giant, with an enormous sweep of breast and the shoulders of a bull. Unlike the others, he was bearded,\n",
        "with a thick, blue-black beard which fell almost to his broad girdle. He wore a robe of purple silk which\n",
        "reflected changing sheens of color with his every movement, and one wide sleeve, drawn back to his\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "425\n",
        "elbow, revealed a forearm massive with corded muscles. The band which confined his blue-black locks\n",
        "was set with glittering jewels.\n",
        "The woman beside him sprang to her feet with a startled exclamation as the strangers entered, and her\n",
        "eyes, passing over Conan, fixed themselves with burning intensity on Valeria. She was tall and lithe, by\n",
        "far the most beautiful woman in the room. She was clad more scantily even than the others; for instead of\n",
        "a skirt she wore merely a broad strip of gilt-worked purple cloth fastened to the middle of her girdle\n",
        "which fell below her knees. Another strip at the back of her girdle completed that part of her costume,\n",
        "which she wore with a cynical indifference. Her breast-plates and the circlet about her temples were\n",
        "adorned with gems. In her eyes alone of all the dark-skinned people there lurked no brooding gleam of\n",
        "madness. She spoke no word after her first exclamation; she stood tensely, her hands clenched, staring at\n",
        "Valeria.\n",
        "The man on the ivory seat had not risen.\n",
        "\"Prince Olmec,\" spoke Techotl, bowing low, with arms outspread and the palms of his hands turned\n",
        "upward, \"I bring allies from the world beyond the forest. In the Chamber of Techotl the Burning Skull\n",
        "slew Chicmec, my companion--\"\n",
        "\"The Burning Skull!\" It was a shuddering whisper of fear from the people of Tecuhltli.\n",
        "\"Aye! Then came I, and found Chicmec lying with his throat cut. Before I could flee, the Burning Skull\n",
        "came upon me, and when I looked upon it my blood became as ice and the marrow of my bones melted. I\n",
        "could neither fight nor run. I could only await the stroke. Then came this white-skinned woman and\n",
        "struck him down with her sword; and lo, it was only a dog of Xotalanc with white paint upon his skin\n",
        "and the living skull of an ancient wizard upon his head! Now that skull lies in many pieces, and the dog\n",
        "who wore it is a dead man!\"\n",
        "An indescribably fierce exultation edged the last sentence, and was echoed in the low, savage\n",
        "exclamations from the crowding listeners.\n",
        "\"But wait!\" exclaimed Techotl. \"There is more! While I talked with the woman, four Xotalancs came upon\n",
        "us! One I slew--there is the stab in my thigh to prove how desperate was the fight. Two the woman killed.\n",
        "But we were hard pressed when this man came into the fray and split the skull of the fourth! Aye! Five\n",
        "crimson nails there are to be driven into the pillar of vengeance!\"\n",
        "He pointed to a black column of ebony which stood behind the dais. Hundreds of red dots scarred its\n",
        "polished surface--the bright scarlet heads of heavy copper nails driven into the black wood.\n",
        "\"Five red nails for five Xotalanca lives!\" exulted Techotl, and the horrible exultation in the faces of the\n",
        "listeners made them inhuman.\n",
        "\"Who are these people?\" asked Olmec, and his voice was like the low, deep rumble of a distant bull. None\n",
        "of the people of Xuchotl spoke loudly. It was as if they had absorbed into their souls the silence of the\n",
        "empty halls and deserted chambers.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "426\n",
        "\"I am Conan, a Cimmerian,\" answered the barbarian briefly. \"This woman is Valeria of the Red\n",
        "Brotherhood, an Aquilonian pirate. We are deserters from an army on the Darfar border, far to the north,\n",
        "and are trying to reach the coast.\"\n",
        "The woman on the dais spoke loudly, her words tripping in her haste.\n",
        "\"You can never reach the coast! There is no escape from Xuchotl! You will spend the rest of your lives in\n",
        "this city!\"\n",
        "\"What do you mean,\" growled Conan, clapping his hand to his hilt and stepping about so as to face both\n",
        "the dais and the rest of the room. \"Are you telling us we're prisoners?\"\n",
        "\"She did not mean that,\" interposed Olmec. \"We are your friends. We would not restrain you against your\n",
        "will. But I fear other circumstances will make it impossible for you to leave Xuchotl.\"\n",
        "His eyes flickered to Valeria, and he lowered them quickly.\n",
        "\"This woman is Tascela,\" he said. \"She is a princess of Tecuhltli. But let food and drink be brought our\n",
        "guests. Doubtless they are hungry, and weary from their long travels.\"\n",
        "He indicated an ivory table, and after an exchange of glances, the adventurers seated themselves. The\n",
        "Cimmerian was suspicious. His fierce blue eyes roved about the chamber, and he kept his sword close to\n",
        "his hand. But an invitation to eat and drink never found him backward. His eyes kept wandering to\n",
        "Tascela, but the princess had eyes only for his white-skinned companion.\n",
        "Techotl, who had bound a strip of silk about his wounded thigh, placed himself at the table to attend to\n",
        "the wants of his friends, seeming to consider it a privilege and honor to see after their needs. He\n",
        "inspected the food and drink the others brought in gold vessels and dishes, and tasted each before he\n",
        "placed it before his guests. While they ate, Olmec sat in silence on his ivory seat, watching them from\n",
        "under his broad black brows. Tascela sat beside him, chin cupped in her hands and her elbows resting on\n",
        "her knees. Her dark, enigmatic eyes, burning with a mysterious light, never left Valeria's supple figure.\n",
        "Behind her seat a sullen handsome girl waved an ostrich-plume fan with a slow rhythm.\n",
        "The food was fruit of an exotic kind unfamiliar to the wanderers, but very palatable, and the drink was a\n",
        "light crimson wine that carried a heady tang.\n",
        "\"You have come from afar,\" said Olmec at last. \"I have read the books of our fathers. Aquilonia lies\n",
        "beyond the lands of the Stygians and the Shemites, beyond Argos and Zingara; and Cimmeria lies\n",
        "beyond Aquilonia.\"\n",
        "\"We have each a roving foot,\" answered Conan carelessly.\n",
        "\"How you won through the forest is a wonder to me,\" quoth Olmec. \"In bygone days a thousand fighting\n",
        "men scarcely were able to carve a road through its perils.\"\n",
        "\"We encountered a bench-legged monstrosity about the size of a mastodon,\" said Conan casually, holding\n",
        "out his wine goblet which Techutl filled with evident pleasure. \"But when we'd killed it we had no\n",
        "further trouble.\"\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "427\n",
        "The wine vessel slipped from Techotl's hand to crash on the floor. His dusky skin went ashy. Olmec\n",
        "started to his feet, an image of stunned amazement, and a low gasp of awe or terror breathed up from the\n",
        "others. Some slipped to their knees as if their legs would not support them. Only Tascela seemed not to\n",
        "have heard. Conan glared about him bewilderedly.\n",
        "\"What's the matter? What are you gaping about?\"\n",
        "\"You--you slew the dragon-god?\"\n",
        "\"God? I killed a dragon. Why not? It was trying to gobble us up.\"\n",
        "\"But dragons are immortal!\" exclaimed Olmec. \"They slay each other, but no man ever killed a dragon!\n",
        "The thousand fighting men of our ancestors who fought their way to Xuchotl could not prevail against\n",
        "them! Their swords broke like twigs against their scales!\"\n",
        "\"If your ancestors had thought to dip their spears in the poisonous juice of Derketa's Apples,\" quoth\n",
        "Conan, with his mouth full, \"and jab them in the eyes or mouth or somewhere like that, they'd have seen\n",
        "that dragons are no more immortal than any other chunk of beef. The carcass lies at the edge of the trees,\n",
        "just within the forest. If you don't believe me, go and look for yourself.\"\n",
        "Olmec shook his head, not in disbelief but in wonder.\n",
        "\"It was because of the dragons that our ancestors took refuge in Xuchotl,\" said he. \"They dared not pass\n",
        "through the plain and plunge into the forest beyond. Scores of them were seized and devoured by the\n",
        "monsters before they could reach the city.\"\n",
        "\"Then your ancestors didn't build Xuchotl?\" asked Valeria.\n",
        "\"It was ancient when they first came into the land. How long it had stood here, not even its degenerate\n",
        "inhabitants knew.\"\n",
        "\"Your people came from Lake Zuad?\" questioned Conan.\n",
        "\"Aye. More than half a century ago a tribe of the Tlazitlans rebelled against the Stygian king, and, being\n",
        "defeated in battle, fled southward. For many weeks they wandered over grasslands, desert and hills, and\n",
        "at last they came into the great forest, a thousand fighting men with their women and children.\n",
        "\"It was in the forest that the dragons fell upon them and tore many to pieces; so the people fled in a\n",
        "frenzy of fear before them, and at last came into the plain and saw the city of Xuchotl in the midst of it.\n",
        "\"They camped before the city, not daring to leave the plain, for the night was made hideous with the\n",
        "noise of the battling monsters through the forest. They made war incessantly upon one another. Yet they\n",
        "came not into the plain.\n",
        "\"The people of the city shut their gates and shot arrows at our people from the walls. The Tlazitlans were\n",
        "imprisoned on the plain, as if the ring of the forest had been a great wall; for to venture into the woods\n",
        "would have been madness.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "428\n",
        "\"That night there came secretly to their camp a slave from the city, one of their own blood, who with a\n",
        "band of exploring soldiers had wandered into the forest long before, when he was a young man. The\n",
        "dragons had devoured all his companions, but he had been taken into the city to dwell in servitude. His\n",
        "name was Tolkemec.\" A flame lighted the dark eyes at mention of the name, and some of the people\n",
        "muttered obscenely and spat. \"He promised to open the gates to the warriors. He asked only that all\n",
        "captives taken be delivered into his hands.\n",
        "\"At dawn he opened the gates. The warriors swarmed in and the halls of Xuchotl ran red. Only a few\n",
        "hundred folk dwelt there, decaying remnants of a once great race. Tolkemec said they came from the east,\n",
        "long ago, from Old Kosala, when the ancestors of those who now dwell in Kosala came up from the south\n",
        "and drove forth the original inhabitants of the land. They wandered far westward and finally found this\n",
        "forest-girdled plain, inhabited then by a tribe of black people.\n",
        "\"These they enslaved and set to building a city. From the hills to the east they brought jade and marble\n",
        "and lapis lazuli, and gold, silver, and copper. Herds of elephants provided them with ivory. When their\n",
        "city was completed, they slew all the black slaves. And their magicians made a terrible magic to guard the\n",
        "city; for by their necromantic arts they re-created the dragons which had once dwelt in this lost land, and\n",
        "whose monstrous bones they found in the forest. Those bones they clothed in flesh and life, and the living\n",
        "beasts walked the earth as they walked it when time was young. But the wizards wove a spell that kept\n",
        "them in the forest and they came not into the plain.\n",
        "\"So for many centuries the people of Xuchotl dwelt in their city, cultivating the fertile plain, until their\n",
        "wise men learned how to grow fruit within the city--fruit which is not planted in soil, but obtains its\n",
        "nourishment out of the air--and then they let the irrigation ditches run dry and dwelt more and more in\n",
        "luxurious sloth, until decay seized them. They were a dying race when our ancestors broke through the\n",
        "forest and came into the plain. Their wizards had died, and the people had forgot their ancient\n",
        "necromancy. They could fight neither by sorcery nor the sword.\n",
        "\"Well, our fathers slew the people of Xuchotl, all except a hundred which were given living into the\n",
        "hands of Tolkemec, who had been their slave; and for many days and nights the halls re-echoed to their\n",
        "screams under the agony of his tortures.\n",
        "\"So the Tlazitlans dwelt here, for a while in peace, ruled by the brothers Tecuhltli and Xotalanc, and by\n",
        "Tolkemec. Tolkemec took a girl of the tribe to wife, and because he had opened the gates, and because he\n",
        "knew many of the arts of the Xuchotlans, he shared the rule of the tribe with the brothers who had led the\n",
        "rebellion and the flight.\n",
        "\"For a few years, then, they dwelt at peace within the city, doing little but eating, drinking, and making\n",
        "love, and raising children. There was no necessity to till the plain, for Tolkemec taught them how to\n",
        "cultivate the air-devouring fruits. Besides, the slaying of the Xuchotlans broke the spell that held the\n",
        "dragons in the forest, and they came nightly and bellowed about the gates of the city. The plain ran red\n",
        "with the blood of their eternal warfare, and it was then that--\" He bit his tongue in the midst of the\n",

        "decided that the matter should be left to the woman. She chose to remain with Tecuhltli. In wrath\n",
        "Xotalanc sought to take her back by force, and the retainers of the brothers came to blows in the Great\n",
        "Hall.\n",
        "\"There was much bitterness. Blood was shed on both sides. The quarrel became a feud, the feud an open\n",
        "war. From the welter three factions emerged--Tecuhltli, Xotalanc, and Tolkemec. Already, in the days of\n",
        "peace, they had divided the city between them. Tecuhltli dwelt in the western quarter of the city,\n",
        "Xotalanc in the eastern, and Tolkemec with his family by the southern gate.\n",
        "\"Anger and resentment and jealousy blossomed into bloodshed and rape and murder. Once the sword\n",
        "was drawn there was no turning back; for blood called for blood, and vengeance followed swift on the\n",
        "heels of atrocity. Tecuhltli fought with Xotalanc, and Tolkemec aided first one and then the other,\n",
        "betraying each faction as it fitted his purposes. Tecuhltli and his people withdrew into the quarter of the\n",
        "western gate, where we now sit. Xuchotl is built in the shape of an oval. Tecuhltli, which took its name\n",
        "from its prince, occupies the western end of the oval. The people blocked up all doors connecting the\n",
        "quarter with the rest of the city, except one on each floor, which could be defended easily. They went into\n",
        "the pits below the city and built a wall cutting off the western end of the catacombs, where lie the bodies\n",
        "of the ancient Xuchotlans, and of those Tlazitlans slain in the feud. They dwelt as in a besieged castle,\n",
        "making sorties and forays on their enemies.\n",
        "\"The people of Xotalanc likewise fortified the eastern quarter of the city, and Tolkemec did likewise with\n",
        "the quarter by the southern gate. The central part of the city was left bare and uninhabited. Those empty\n",
        "halls and chambers became a battleground, and a region of brooding terror.\n",
        "\"Tolkemec warred on both clans. He was a fiend in the form of a human, worse than Xotalanc. He knew\n",
        "many secrets of the city he never told the others. From the crypts of the catacombs he plundered the dead\n",
        "of their grisly secrets--secrets of ancient kings and wizards, long forgotten by the degenerate Xuchotlans\n",
        "our ancestors slew. But all his magic did not aid him the night we of Tecuhltli stormed his castle and\n",
        "butchered all his people. Tolkemec we tortured for many days.\"\n",

        "\"Aye, we kept the life in him until he screamed for death as for a bride. At last we took him living from\n",
        "the torture chamber and cast him into a dungeon for the rats to gnaw as he died. From that dungeon,\n",
        "somehow, he managed to escape, and dragged himself into the catacombs. There without doubt he died,\n",
        "for the only way out of the catacombs beneath Tecuhltli is through Tecuhltli, and he never emerged by\n",
        "that way. His bones were never found and the superstitious among our people swear that his ghost\n",
        "haunts the crypts to this day, wailing among the bones of the dead. Twelve years ago we butchered the\n",
        "people of Tolkemec, but the feud raged on between Tecuhltli and Xotalanc, as it will rage until the last\n",

        "\"We are a dying race, even as were those Xuchotlans our ancestors slew. When the feud began there were\n",
        "hundreds in each faction. Now we of Tecuhltli number only these you see before you, and the men who\n",
        "guard the four doors: forty in all. How many Xotalancas there are we do not know, but I doubt if they are\n",
        "much more numerous than we. For fifteen years no children have been born to us, and we have seen\n",
        "none among the Xotalancas.\n",
        "\"We are dying, but before we die we will slay as many of the men of Xotalanc as the gods permit.\"\n",

        "splashed with deeper crimson from severed veins. In that long butchery a whole generation had perished.\n",
        "Xotalanc was dead, long ago, slain in a grim battle on an ivory stair. Tecuhltli was dead, flayed alive by\n",
        "the maddened Xotalancas who had captured him.\n",
        "Without emotion Olmec told of hideous battles fought in black corridors, of ambushes on twisting stairs,\n",
        "and red butcheries. With a redder, more abysmal gleam in his deep dark eyes he told of men and women\n",
        "flayed alive, mutilated and dismembered, of captives howling under tortures so ghastly that even the\n",
        "barbarous Cimmerian grunted. No wonder Techotl had trembled with the terror of capture! Yet he had\n",
        "gone forth to slay if he could, driven by hate that was stronger than his fear. Olmec spoke further, of dark\n",
        "and mysterious matters, of black magic and wizardry conjured out of the black night of the catacombs, of\n",
        "weird creatures invoked out of darkness for horrible allies. In these things the Xotalancas had the\n",
        "advantage, for it was in the eastern catacombs where lay the bones of the greatest wizards of the ancient\n",
        "Xuchotlans, with their immemorial secrets.\n",
        "Valeria listened with morbid fascination. The feud had become a terrible elemental power driving the\n",
        "people of Xuchotl inexorably on to doom and extinction. It filled their whole lives. They were born in it,\n",
        "and they expected to die in it. They never left their barricaded castle except to steal forth into the Halls of\n",
        "Silence that lay between the opposing fortresses, to slay and be slain. Sometimes the raiders returned\n",
        "with frantic captives, or with grim tokens of victory in fight. Sometimes they did not return at all, or\n",
        "returned only as severed limbs cast down before the bolted bronze doors. It was a ghastly, unreal\n",
        "nightmare existence these people lived, shut off from the rest of the world, caught together like rabid rats\n",
        "in the same trap, butchering one another through the years, crouching and creeping through the sunless\n",
        "corridors to maim and torture and murder.\n",
        "While Olmec talked, Valeria felt the blazing eyes of Tascela fixed upon her. The princess seemed not to\n",
        "hear what Olmec was saying. Her expression, as he narrated victories or defeats, did not mirror the wild\n",
        "rage or fiendish exultation that alternated on the faces of the other Tecuhltli. The feud that was an\n",
        "obsession to her clansmen seemed meaningless to her. Valeria found her indifferent callousness more\n",
        "repugnant than Olmec's naked ferocity.\n",
        "\"And we can never leave the city,\" said Olmec. \"For fifty years on one has left it except those--\" Again he\n",
        "checked himself.\n",
        "\"Even without the peril of the dragons,\" he continued, \"we who were born and raised in the city would\n",
        "not dare leave it. We have never set foot outside the walls. We are not accustomed to the open sky and\n",
        "the naked sun. No; we were born in Xuchotl, and in Xuchotl we shall die.\"\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "431\n",
        "\"Well,\" said Conan, \"with your leave we'll take our chances with the dragons. This feud is none of our\n",
        "business. If you'll show us to the west gate we'll be on our way.\"\n",
        "Tascela's hands clenched, and she started to speak, but Olmec interrupted her: \"It is nearly nightfall. If\n",
        "you wander forth into the plain by night, you will certainly fall prey to the dragons.\"\n",
        "\"We crossed it last night, and slept in the open without seeing any,\" returned Conan.\n",
        "Tascela smiled mirthlessly. \"You dare not leave Xuchotl!\"\n",
        "Conan glared at her with instinctive antagonism; she was not looking at him, but at the woman opposite\n",
        "him.\n",
        "\"I think they dare,\" stated Olmec. \"But look you, Conan and Valeria, the gods must have sent you to us, to\n",
        "cast victory into the laps of the Tecuhltli! You are professional fighters--why not fight for us? We have\n",
        "wealth in abundance--precious jewels are as common in Xuchotl as cobblestones are in the cities of the\n",
        "world. Some the Xuchotlans brought with them from Kosala. Some, like the firestones, they found in the\n",
        "hills to the east. Aid us to wipe out the Xotalancas, and we will give you all the jewels you can carry.\"\n",
        "\"And will you help us destroy the dragons?\" asked Valeria. \"With bows and poisoned arrows thirty men\n",
        "could slay all the dragons in the forest.\"\n",
        "\"Aye!\" replied Olmec promptly. \"We have forgotten the use of the bow, in years of hand-to-hand fighting,\n",
        "but we can learn again.\"\n",
        "\"What do you say?\" Valeria inquired of Conan.\n",
        "\"We're both penniless vagabonds,\" he grinned hardily. \"I'd as soon kill Xotalancas as anybody.\"\n",
        "\"Then you agree?\" exclaimed Olmec, while Techotl fairly hugged himself with delight.\n",
        "\"Aye. And now suppose you show us chambers where we can sleep, so we can be fresh tomorrow for the\n",
        "beginning of the slaying.\"\n",
        "Olmec nodded, and waved a hand, and Techotl and a woman led the adventurers into a corridor which\n",
        "led through a door off to the left of the jade dais. A glance back showed Valeria Olmec sitting on his\n",
        "throne, chin on knotted fist, staring after them. His eyes burned with a weird flame. Tascela leaned back\n",
        "in her seat, whispering to the sullen-faced maid, Yasala, who leaned over her shoulder, her ear to the\n",
        "princess's moving lips.\n",
        "The hallway was not so broad as most they had traversed, but it was long. Presently the woman halted,\n",
        "opened a door, and drew aside for Valeria to enter.\n",
        "\"Wait a minute,\" growled Conan. \"Where do I sleep?\"\n",
        "Techotl pointed to a chamber across the hallway, but one door farther down. Conan hesitated, and\n",
        "seemed inclined to raise an objection, but Valeria smiled spitefully at him and shut the door in his face.\n",
        "He muttered something uncomplimentary about women in general, and strode off down the corridor\n",
        "after Techotl.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "432\n",
        "In the ornate chamber where he was to sleep, he glanced up at the slot-like skylights. Some were wide\n",
        "enough to admit the body of a slender man, supposing the glass were broken.\n",
        "\"Why don't the Xotalancas come over the roofs and shatter those skylights?\" he asked.\n",
        "\"They cannot be broken,\" answered Techotl. \"Besides, the roofs would be hard to clamber over. They are\n",
        "mostly spires and domes and steep ridges.\"\n",
        "He volunteered more information about the \"castle\" of Tecuhltli. Like the rest of the city it contained four\n",
        "stories, or tiers of chambers, with towers jutting up from the roof. Each tier was named; indeed, the\n",
        "people of Xuchotl had a name for each chamber, hall, and stair in the city, as people of more normal cities\n",
        "designate streets and quarters. In Tecuhltli the floors were named The Eagle's Tier, The Ape's Tier, The\n",
        "Tiger's Tier and The Serpent's Tier, in the order as enumerated, The Eagle's Tier being the highest, or\n",
        "fourth, floor.\n",
        "\"Who is Tascela?\" asked Conan. \"Olmec's wife?\"\n",
        "Techotl shuddered and glanced furtively about him before answering.\n",
        "\"No. She is--Tascela! She was the wife of Xotalanc--the woman Tecuhltli stole, to start the feud.\"\n",
        "\"What are you talking about?\" demanded Conan. \"That woman is beautiful and young. Are you trying to\n",
        "tell me that she was a wife fifty years ago?\"\n",
        "\"Aye! I swear it! She was a full-grown woman when the Tlazitlans journeyed from Lake Zuad. It was\n",
        "because the king of Stygia desired her for a concubine that Xotalanc and his brother rebelled and fled into\n",
        "the wilderness. She is a witch, who possesses the secret of perpetual youth.\"\n",
        "\"What's that?\" asked Conan.\n",
        "Techotl shuddered again.\n",
        "\"Ask me not! I dare not speak. It is too grisly, even for Xuchotl!\"\n",
        "And touching his finger to his lips, he glided from the chamber.\n",

        "Scent\n",
        "of\n",

        "\n",
        "Valeria unbuckled her sword belt and laid it with the sheathed weapon on the couch where she meant to\n",
        "sleep. She noted that the doors were supplied with bolts, and asked where they led.\n",
        "\"Those lead to adjoining chambers,\" answered the woman, indicating the doors on right and left. \"That\n",
        "one?\"--pointing to a copper-bound door opposite that which opened into the corridor--\"leads to a corridor\n",
        "which runs to a stair that descends into the catacombs. Do not fear; naught can harm you here.\"\n",
        "\"Who spoke of fear?\" snapped Valeria. \"I just like to know what sort of harbor I'm dropping anchor in. No,\n",
        "I don't want you to sleep at the foot of my couch. I'm not accustomed to being waited on--not by women,\n",
        "anyway. You have my leave to go.\"\n",
        "Alone in the room, the pirate shot the bolts on all the doors, kicked off her boots and stretched\n",
        "luxuriously out on the couch. She imagined Conan similarly situated across the corridor, but her feminine\n",
        "vanity prompted her to visualize him as scowling and muttering with chagrin as he cast himself on his\n",
        "solitary couch, and she grinned with gleeful malice as she prepared herself for slumber.\n",
        "Outside, night had fallen. In the halls of Xuchotl the green fire-jewels blazed like the eyes of prehistoric\n",
        "cats. Somewhere among the dark towers, a night wind moaned like a restless spirit. Through the dim\n",
        "passages, stealthy figures began stealing, like disembodied shadows.\n",
        "Valeria awoke suddenly on her couch. In the dusky emerald glow of the fire-gems she saw a shadowy\n",
        "figure bending over her. For a bemused instant the apparition seemed part of the dream she had been\n",
        "dreaming. She had seemed to lie on the couch in the chamber as she was actually lying, while over her\n",
        "pulsed and throbbed a gigantic black blossom so enormous that it hid the ceiling. Its exotic perfume\n",
        "pervaded her being, inducing a delicious, sensuous languor that was something more and less than sleep.\n",
        "She was sinking into scented billows of insensible bliss, when something touched her face. So\n",
        "supersensitive were her drugged senses, that the light touch was like a dislocating impact, jolting her\n",
        "rudely into full wakefulness. Then it was that she saw, not a gargantuan blossom, but a dark-skinned\n",
        "woman standing above her.\n",
        "With the realization came anger and instant action. The woman turned lithely, but before she could run\n",
        "Valeria was on her feet and had caught her arm. She fought like a wildcat for an instant, and then\n",
        "subsided as she felt herself crushed by the superior strength of her captor. The pirate wrenched the\n",
        "woman around to face her, caught her chin with her free hand and forced her captive to meet her gaze. It\n",
        "was the sullen Yasala, Tascela's maid.\n",
        "\"What the devil were you doing bending over me? What's that in your hand?\"\n",
        "The woman made no reply, but sought to cast away the object. Valeria twisted her arm around in front of\n",
        "her, and the thing fell to the floor--a great black exotic blossom on a jade-green stem, large as a woman's\n",
        "head, to be sure, but tiny beside the exaggerated vision she had seen.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "434\n",
        "\"The black lotus!\" said Valeria between her teeth. \"The blossom whose scent brings deep sleep. You were\n",
        "trying to drug me! If you hadn't accidentally touched my face with the petals, you'd have--why did you\n",
        "do it? What's your game?\"\n",
        "Yasala maintained a sulky silence, and with an oath Valeria whirled her around, forced her to her knees\n",
        "and twisted her arm up behind her back.\n",
        "\"Tell me, or I'll tear your arm out of its socket!\"\n",
        "Yasala squirmed in anguish as her arm was forced excruciatingly up between her shoulder blades, but a\n",
        "violent shaking of her head was the only answer she made.\n",
        "\"Slut!\" Valeria cast her from her to sprawl on the floor. The pirate glared at the prostrate figure with\n",
        "blazing eyes. Fear and the memory of Tascela's burning eyes stirred in her, rousing all her tigerish\n",
        "instincts of self-preservation. These people were decadent; any sort of perversity might be expected to be\n",
        "encountered among them. But Valeria sensed here something that moved behind the scenes, some secret\n",
        "terror fouler than common degeneracy. Fear and revulsion of this weird city swept her. These people\n",
        "were neither sane nor normal; she began to doubt if they were even human. Madness smoldered in the\n",
        "eyes of them all--all except the cruel, cryptic eyes of Tascela, which held secrets and mysteries more\n",
        "abysmal than madness.\n",
        "She lifted her head and listened intently. The halls of Xuchotl were as silent as if it were in reality a dead\n",
        "city. The green jewels bathed the chamber in a nightmare glow, in which the eyes of the woman on the\n",
        "floor glittered eerily up at her. A thrill of panic throbbed through Valeria, driving the last vestige of\n",
        "mercy from her fierce soul.\n",
        "\"Why did you try to drug me?\" she muttered, grasping the woman's black hair, and forcing her head back\n",
        "to glare into her sullen, long-lashed eyes. \"Did Tascela send you?\"\n",
        "No answer. Valeria cursed venomously and slapped the woman first on one cheek and then the other.\n",
        "The blows resounded through the room, but Yasala made no outcry.\n",
        "\"Why don't you scream?\" demanded Valeria savagely. \"Do you fear someone will hear you? Whom do\n",
        "you fear? Tascela? Olmec? Conan?\"\n",
        "Yasala made no reply. She crouched, watching her captor with eyes baleful as those of a basilisk.\n",
        "Stubborn silence always fans anger. Valeria turned and tore a handful of cords from a near-by hanging.\n",
        "\"You sulky slut!\" she said between her teeth. \"I'm going to strip you stark naked and tie you across that\n",
        "couch and whip you until you tell me what you were doing here, and who sent you!\"\n",
        "Yasala made no verbal protest, nor did she offer any resistance, as Valeria carried out the first part of her\n",
        "thereat with a fury that her captive's obstinacy only sharpened. Then for a space there was no sound in\n",
        "the chamber except the whistle and crackle of hard-woven silken cords on naked flesh. Yasala could not\n",
        "move her fast-bound hands or feet. Her body writhed and quivered under the chastisement, her head\n",
        "swayed from side to side in rhythm with the blows. Her teeth were sunk into her lower lip and a trickle\n",
        "of blood began as the punishment continued. But she did not cry out.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "435\n",
        "The pliant cords made no great sound as they encountered the quivering body of the captive; only a\n",
        "sharp crackling snap, but each cord left a red streak across Yasala's dark flesh. Valeria inflicted the\n",
        "punishment with all the strength of her war-hardened arm, with all the mercilessness acquired during a\n",
        "life where pain and torment were daily happenings, and with all the cynical ingenuity which only a\n",
        "woman displays toward a woman. Yasala suffered more, physically and mentally, than she would have\n",
        "suffered under a lash wielded by a man, however strong.\n",
        "It was the application of this feminine cynicism which at last tamed Yasala.\n",
        "A low whimper escaped from her lips, and Valeria paused, arm lifted, and raked back a damp yellow\n",
        "lock. \"Well, are you going to talk?\" she demanded. \"I can keep this up all night, if necessary.\"\n",
        "\"Mercy!\" whispered the woman. \"I will tell.\"\n",
        "Valeria cut the cords from her wrists and ankles, and pulled her to her feet. Yasala sank down on the\n",
        "couch, half reclining on one bare hip, supporting herself on her arm, and writhing at the contact of her\n",
        "smarting flesh with the couch. She was trembling in every limb.\n",
        "\"Wine!\" she begged, dry-lipped, indicating with a quivering hand a gold vessel on an ivory table. \"Let me\n",
        "drink. I am weak with pain. Then I will tell you all.\"\n",
        "Valeria picked up the vessel, and Yasala rose unsteadily to receive it. She took it, raised it toward her lips-\n",
        "-then dashed the contents full into the Aquilonian's face. Valeria reeled backward, shaking and clawing\n",
        "the stinging liquid out of her eyes. Through a smarting mist she saw Yasala dart across the room, fling\n",
        "back a bolt, throw open the copper-bound door and run down the hall. The pirate was after her instantly,\n",
        "sword out and murder in her heart.\n",
        "But Yasala had the start, and she ran with the nervous agility of a woman who has just been whipped to\n",
        "the point of hysterical frenzy. She rounded a corner in the corridor, yards ahead of Valeria, and when the\n",
        "pirate turned it, she saw only an empty hall, and at the other end a door that gaped blackly. A damp\n",
        "moldy scent reeked up from it, and Valeria shivered. That must be the door that led to the catacombs.\n",
        "Yasala had taken refuge among the dead.\n",
        "Valeria advanced to the door and looked down a flight of stone steps that vanished quickly into utter\n",
        "blackness. Evidently it was a shaft that led straight to the pits below the city, without opening upon any\n",
        "of the lower floors. She shivered slightly at the thought of the thousands of corpses lying in their stone\n",
        "crypts down there, wrapped in their moldering cloths. She had no intention of groping her way down\n",
        "those stone steps. Yasala doubtless knew every turn and twist of the subterranean tunnels.\n",
        "She was turning back, baffled and furious, when a sobbing cry welled up from the blackness. It seemed to\n",
        "come from a great depth, but human words were faintly distinguishable, and the voice was that of a\n",
        "woman. \"Oh, help! Help, in Set's name! Ahhh!\" It trailed away, and Valeria thought she caught the echo\n",
        "of a ghostly tittering.\n",
        "Valeria felt her skin crawl. What had happened to Yasala down there in the thick blackness? There was\n",
        "no doubt that it had been she who had cried out. But what peril could have befallen her? Was a Xotalanca\n",
        "lurking down there? Olmec had assured them that the catacombs below Tecuhltli were walled off from\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "436\n",
        "the rest, too securely for their enemies to break through. Besides, that tittering had not sounded like a\n",
        "human being at all.\n",
        "Valeria hurried back down the corridor, not stopping to close the door that opened on the stair.\n",
        "Regaining her chamber, she closed the door and shot the bolt behind her. She pulled on her boots and\n",
        "buckled her sword-belt about her. She was determined to make her way to Conan's room and urge him, if\n",
        "he still lived, to join her in an attempt to fight their way out of that city of devils.\n",
        "But even as she reached the door that opened into the corridor, a long-drawn scream of agony rang\n",
        "through the halls, followed by the stamp of running feet and the loud clangor of swords.\n",
        "Twenty\n",
        "Red\n",
        "Nails\n",
        "\n",
        "Two warriors lounged in the guardroom on the floor known as the Tier of the Eagle. Their attitude was\n",
        "casual, though habitually alert. An attack on the great bronze door from without was always a possibility,\n",
        "but for many years no such assault had been attempted on either side.\n",
        "\"The strangers are strong allies,\" said one. \"Olmec will move against the enemy tomorrow, I believe.\"\n",
        "He spoke as a soldier in a war might have spoken. In the miniature world of Xuchotl each handful of\n",
        "feudists was an army, and the empty halls between the castles was the country over which they\n",

        "The other meditated for a space.\n",
        "\"Suppose with their aid we destroy Xotalanc,\" he said. \"What then, Xatmec?\"\n",
        "\"Why,\" returned Xatmec, \"we will drive red nails for them all. The captives we will burn and flay and\n",
        "quarter.\"\n",
        "\"But afterward?\" pursued the other. \"After we have slain them all? Will it not seem strange to have no foe\n",

        "Xatmec shrugged his shoulders. His thoughts had never gone beyond the destruction of their foes. They\n",
        "could not go beyond that.\n",
        "Suddenly both men stiffened at a noise outside the door.\n",
        "\"To the door, Xatmec!\" hissed the last speaker. \"I shall look through the Eye--\"\n",
        "Xatmec, sword in hand, leaned against the bronze door, straining his ear to hear through the metal. His\n",
        "mate looked into the mirror. He started convulsively. Men were clustered thickly outside the door; grim,\n",
        "dark-faced men with swords gripped in their teeth--and their fingers thrust into their ears. One who wore\n",
        "a feathered headdress had a set of pipes which he set to his lips, and even as the Tecuhltli started to shout\n",
        "a warning, the pipes began to skirl.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "437\n",
        "The cry died in the guard's throat as the thin, weird piping penetrated the metal door and smote on his\n",
        "ears. Xatmec leaned frozen against the door, as if paralyzed in that position. His face was that of a\n",
        "wooden image, his expression one of horrified listening. The other guard, farther removed from the\n",
        "source of the sound, yet sensed the horror of what was taking place, the grisly threat that lay in that\n",
        "demoniac fifing. He felt the weird strains plucking like unseen fingers at the tissues of his brain, filling\n",
        "him with alien emotions and impulses of madness. But with a soul-tearing effort he broke the spell, and\n",
        "shrieked a warning in a voice he did not recognize as his own.\n",
        "But even as he cried out, the music changed to an unbearable shrilling that was like a knife in the\n",
        "eardrums. Xatmec screamed in sudden agony, and all the sanity went out of his face like a flame blown\n",
        "out in a wind. Like a madman he ripped loose the chain, tore open the door and rushed out into the hall,\n",
        "sword lifted before his mate could stop him. A dozen blades struck him down, and over his mangled\n",
        "body the Xotalancas surged into the guardroom, with a long-drawn, blood-mad yell that sent the\n",
        "unwonted echoes reverberating.\n",
        "His brain reeling from the shock of it all, the remaining guard leaped to meet them with goring spear. The\n",
        "horror of the sorcery he had just witnessed was submerged in the stunning realization that the enemy\n",
        "were in Tecuhltli. And as his spearhead ripped through a dark-skinned belly he knew no more, for a\n",
        "swinging sword crushed his skull, even as wild-eyed warriors came pouring in from the chambers\n",
        "behind the guardroom.\n",
        "It was the yelling of men and the clanging of steel that brought Conan bounding from his couch, wide\n",
        "awake and broadsword in hand. In an instant he had reached the door and flung it open, and was glaring\n",
        "out into the corridor just as Techotl rushed up it, eyes blazing madly.\n",
        "\"The Xotalancas!\" he screamed, in a voice hardly human. \"They are within the door!\"\n",
        "Conan ran down the corridor, even as Valeria emerged from her chamber.\n",
        "\"What the devil is it?\" she called.\n",
        "\"Techotl says the Xotalancas are in,\" he answered hurriedly. \"That racket sounds like it.\"\n",
        "With the Tecuhltli on their heels they burst into the throne room and were confronted by a scene beyond\n",
        "the most frantic dream of blood and fury. Twenty men and women, their black hair streaming, and the\n",
        "white skulls gleaming on their breasts, were locked in combat with the people of Tecuhltli. The women\n",
        "on both sides fought as madly as the men, and already the room and the hall beyond were strewn with\n",
        "corpses.\n",
        "Olmec, naked but for a breech-clout, was fighting before his throne, and as the adventurers entered,\n",
        "Tascela ran from an inner chamber with a sword in her hand.\n",
        "Xatmec and his mate were dead, so there was none to tell the Tecuhltli how their foes had found their\n",
        "way into their citadel. Nor was there any to say what had prompted that mad attempt. But the losses of\n",
        "the Xotalancas had been greater, their position more desperate, than the Tecuhltli had known. The\n",
        "maiming of their scaly ally, the destruction of the Burning Skull, and the news, gasped by a dying man,\n",
        "that mysterious white-skin allies had joined their enemies, had driven them to the frenzy of desperation\n",
        "and the wild determination to die dealing death to their ancient foes.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "438\n",
        "The Tecuhltli, recovering from the first stunning shock of the surprise that had swept them back into the\n",
        "throne room and littered the floor with their corpses, fought back with an equally desperate fury, while\n",
        "the doorguards from the lower floors came racing to hurl themselves into the fray. It was the deathfight\n",
        "of rabid wolves, blind, panting, merciless. Back and forth it surged, from door to dais, blades whickering\n",
        "and striking into flesh, blood spurting, feet stamping the crimson floor where redder pools were forming.\n",
        "Ivory tables crashed over, seats were splintered, velvet hangings torn down were stained red. It was the\n",
        "bloody climax of a bloody half-century, and every man there sensed it.\n",
        "But the conclusion was inevitable. The Tecuhltli outnumbered the invaders almost two to one, and they\n",
        "were heartened by that fact and by the entrance into the melee of their light-skinned allies.\n",
        "These crashed into the fray with the devastating effect of a hurricane plowing through a grove of saplings.\n",
        "In sheer strength no three Tlazitlans were a match for Conan, and in spite of his weight he was quicker on\n",
        "his feet than any of them. He moved through the whirling, eddying mass with the surety and\n",
        "destructiveness of a gray wolf amidst a pack of alley curs, and he strode over a wake of crumpled figures.\n",
        "Valeria fought beside him, her lips smiling and her eyes blazing. She was stronger than the average man,\n",
        "and far quicker and more ferocious. Her sword was like a living thing in her hand. Where Conan beat\n",
        "down opposition by the sheer weight and power of his blows, breaking spears, splitting skulls and\n",
        "cleaving bosoms to the breastbone, Valeria brought into action a finesse of swordplay that dazzled and\n",
        "bewildered her antagonists before it slew them. Again and again a warrior, heaving high his heavy blade,\n",
        "found her point in his jugular before he could strike. Conan, towering above the field, strode through the\n",
        "welter smiting right and left, but Valeria moved like an illusive phantom, constantly shifting, and\n",
        "thrusting and slashing as she shifted. Swords missed her again and again as the wielders flailed the\n",
        "empty air and died with her point in their hearts or throats, and her mocking laughter in their ears.\n",
        "Neither sex nor condition was considered by the maddened combatants. The five women of the\n",
        "Xotalancas were down with their throats cut before Conan and Valeria entered the fray, and when a man\n",
        "or woman went down under the stamping feet, there was always a knife ready for the helpless throat, or\n",
        "a sandaled foot eager to crush the prostrate skull.\n",
        "From wall to wall, from door to door rolled the waves of combat, spilling over into adjoining chambers.\n",
        "And presently only Tecuhltli and their white-skinned allies stood upright in the great throne room. The\n",
        "survivors stared bleakly and blankly at each other, like survivors after Judgement Day or the destruction\n",
        "of the world. On legs wide-braced, hands gripping notched and dripping swords, blood trickling down\n",
        "their arms, they stared at one another across the mangled corpses of friends and foes. They had no breath\n",
        "left to shout, but a bestial mad howling rose from their lips. It was not a human cry of triumph. It was the\n",
        "howling of a rabid wolf-pack stalking among the bodies of its victims.\n",
        "Conan caught Valeria's arm and turned her about.\n",
        "\"You've got a stab in the calf of your leg,\" he growled.\n",
        "She glanced down, for the first time aware of a stinging in the muscles of her leg. Some dying man on the\n",
        "floor had fleshed his dagger with his last effort.\n",
        "\"You look like a butcher yourself,\" she laughed.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "439\n",
        "He shook a red shower from his hands.\n",
        "\"Not mine. Oh, a scratch here and there. Nothing to bother about. But that calf ought to be bandaged.\"\n",
        "Olmec came through the litter, looking like a ghoul with his naked massive shoulders splashed with\n",
        "blood, and his black beard dabbled in crimson. His eyes were red, like the reflection of flame on black\n",
        "water.\n",
        "\"We have won!\" he croaked dazedly. \"The feud is ended! The dogs of Xotalanc lie dead! Oh, for a captive\n",
        "to flay alive! Yet it is good to look upon their dead faces. Twenty dead dogs! Twenty red nails for the\n",
        "black column!\"\n",
        "\"You'd best see to your wounded,\" grunted Conan, turning away from him. \"Here, girl, let me see that\n",
        "leg.\"\n",
        "\"Wait a minute!\" she shook him off impatiently. The fire of fighting still burned brightly in her soul. \"How\n",
        "do we know these are all of them? These might have come on a raid of their own.\"\n",
        "\"They would not split the clan on a foray like this,\" said Olmec, shaking his head, and regaining some of\n",
        "his ordinary intelligence. Without his purple robe the man seemed less like a prince than some repellent\n",
        "beast of prey. \"I will stake my head upon it that we have slain them all. There were less of them than I\n",
        "dreamed, and they must have been desperate. But how came they in Tecuhltli?\"\n",
        "Tascela came forward, wiping her sword on her naked thigh, and holding in her other hand an object she\n",
        "had taken from the body of the feathered leader of the Xotalancas.\n",
        "\"The pipes of madness,\" she said. \"A warrior tells me that Xatmec opened the door to the Xotalancas and\n",
        "was cut down as they stormed into the guardroom. This warrior came to the guardroom from the inner\n",
        "hall just in time to see it happen and to hear the last of a weird strain of music which froze his very soul.\n",
        "Tolkemec used to talk of these pipes, which the Xuchotlans swore were hidden somewhere in the\n",
        "catacombs with the bones of the ancient wizard who used them in his lifetime. Somehow the dogs of\n",
        "Xotalanc found them and learned their secret.\"\n",
        "\"Somebody ought to go to Xotalanc and see if any remain alive,\" said Conan. \"I'll go if somebody will\n",
        "guide me.\"\n",
        "Olmec glanced at the remnants of his people. There were only twenty left alive, and of these several lay\n",
        "groaning on the floor. Tascela was the only one of the Tecuhltli who had escaped without a wound. The\n",
        "princess was untouched, though she had fought as savagely as any.\n",
        "\"Who will go with Conan to Xotalanc?\" asked Olmec.\n",
        "Techotl limped forward. The wound in his thigh had started bleeding afresh, and he had another gash\n",
        "across his ribs.\n",
        "\"I will go!\"\n",
        "\"No, you won't,\" vetoed Conan. \"And you're not going either, Valeria. In a little while that leg will be\n",
        "getting stiff.\"\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "440\n",
        "\"I will go,\" volunteered a warrior, who was knotting a bandage about a slashed forearm.\n",
        "\"Very well, Yanath. Go with the Cimmerian. And you, too, Topal.\" Olmec indicated another man whose\n",
        "injuries were slight. \"But first aid to lift the badly wounded on these couches where we may bandage\n",
        "their hurts.\"\n",
        "This was done quickly. As they stooped to pick up a woman who had been stunned by a warclub,\n",
        "Olmec's beard brushed Topal's ear. Conan thought the prince muttered something to the warrior, but he\n",
        "could not be sure. A few moments later he was leading his companions down the hall.\n",
        "Conan glanced back as he went out the door, at that shambles where the dead lay on the smoldering floor,\n",
        "blood-stained dark limbs knotted in attitudes of fierce muscular effort, dark faces frozen in masks of hate,\n",
        "glassy eyes glaring up at the green fire-jewels which bathed the ghastly scene in a dusky emerald\n",
        "witchlight. Among the dead the living moved aimlessly, like people moving in a trance. Conan heard\n",
        "Olmec call a woman and direct her to bandage Valeria's leg. The pirate followed the woman into an\n",
        "adjoining chamber, already beginning to limp slightly.\n",
        "Warily the two Tecuhltli led Conan along the hall beyond the bronze door, and through chamber after\n",
        "chamber shimmering in the green fire. They saw no one, heard no sound. After they crossed the Great\n",
        "Hall which bisected the city from north to south, their caution was increased by the realization of their\n",
        "nearness to enemy territory. But chambers and halls lay empty to their wary gaze, and they came at last\n",
        "along a broad dim hallway and halted before a bronze door similar to the Eagle Door of Tecuhltli.\n",
        "Gingerly they tried it, and it opened at silently under their fingers. Awed, they started into the green-lit\n",
        "chambers beyond. For fifty years no Tecuhltli had entered those halls save as a prisoner going to a\n",
        "hideous doom. To go to Xotalanc had been the ultimate horror that could befall a man of the western\n",
        "castle. The terror of it had stalked through their dreams since earliest childhood. To Yanath and Topol\n",
        "that bronze door was like the portal of hell.\n",
        "They cringed back, unreasoning horror in their eyes, and Conan pushed past them and strode into\n",
        "Xotalanc.\n",
        "Timidly they followed him. As each man set foot over the threshold he stared and glared wildly about\n",
        "him. But only their quick, hurried breathing disturbed the silence.\n",
        "They had come into a square guardroom, like that behind the Eagle Door of Tecuhltli, and, similarly, a\n",
        "hall ran away from it to a broad chamber that was a counterpart of Olmec's throne room.\n",
        "Conan glanced down the hall with its rugs and divans and hangings, and stood listening intently. He\n",
        "heard no noise, and the rooms had an empty feel. He did not believe there were any Xotalancas left alive\n",
        "in Xuchotl.\n",
        "\"Come on,\" he muttered, and started down the hall.\n",
        "He had not gone far when he was aware that only Yanath was following him. He wheeled back to see\n",
        "Topal standing in an attitude of horror, one arm out as if to fend off some threatening peril, his distended\n",
        "eyes fixed with hypnotic intensity on something protruding from behind a divan.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "441\n",
        "\"What the devil?\" Then Conan saw what Topal was staring at, and he felt a faint twitching of the skin\n",
        "between his giant shoulders. A monstrous head protruded from behind the divan, a reptilian head, broad\n",
        "as the head of a crocodile, with down-curving fangs that projected over the lower jaw. But there was an\n",
        "unnatural limpness about the thing, and the hideous eyes were glazed.\n",
        "Conan peered behind the couch. It was a great serpent which lay there limp in death, but such a serpent\n",
        "as he had never seen in his wanderings. The reek and chill of the deep black earth were about it, and its\n",
        "color was an indeterminable hue which changed with each new angle from which he surveyed it. A great\n",
        "wound in the neck showed what had caused its death.\n",
        "\"It is the Crawler!\" whispered Yanath.\n",
        "\"It's the thing I slashed on the stair,\" grunted Conan. \"After it trailed us to the Eagle Door, it dragged itself\n",
        "here to die. How could the Xotalancas control such a brute?\"\n",
        "The Tecuhltli shivered and shook their heads.\n",
        "\"They brought it up from the black tunnels below the catacombs. They discovered secrets unknown to\n",
        "Tecuhltli.\"\n",
        "\"Well, it's dead, and if they'd had any more of them, they'd have brought them along when they came to\n",
        "Tecuhltli. Come on.\"\n",
        "They crowded close at his heels as he strode down the hall and thrust on the silver-worked door at the\n",
        "other end.\n",
        "\"If we don't find anybody on this floor,\" he said, \"we'll descend into the lower floors. We'll explore\n",
        "Xotalanc from the roof to the catacombs. If Xotalanc is like Tecuhltli, all the rooms and halls in this tier\n",
        "will be lighted--what the devil!\"\n",
        "They had come into the broad throne chamber, so similar to that one in Tecuhltli. There were the same\n",
        "jade dais and ivory seat, the same divans, rugs and hangings on the walls. No black, red-scarred column\n",
        "stood behind the throne-dais, but evidences of the grim feud were not lacking.\n",
        "Ranged along the wall behind the dais were rows of glass-covered shelves. And on those shelves\n",
        "hundreds of human heads, perfectly preserved, stared at the startled watchers with emotionless eyes, as\n",
        "they had stared for only the gods knew how many months and years.\n",
        "Topal muttered a curse, but Yanath stood silent, the mad light growing in his wide eyes. Conan frowned,\n",
        "knowing that Tlazitlan sanity was hung on a hair-trigger.\n",
        "Suddenly Yanath pointed to the ghastly relics with a twitching finger.\n",
        "\"There is my brother's head!\" he murmured. \"And there is my father's younger brother! And there beyond\n",
        "them is my sister's eldest son!\"\n",
        "Suddenly he began to weep, dry-eyed, with harsh, loud sobs that shook his frame. He did not take his\n",
        "eyes from the heads. His sobs grew shriller, changed to frightful, high-pitched laughter, and that in turn\n",
        "became an unbearable screaming. Yanath was stark mad.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "442\n",
        "Conan laid a hand on his shoulder, and as if the touch had released all the frenzy in his soul, Yanath\n",
        "screamed and whirled, striking at the Cimmerian with his sword. Conan parried the blow, and Topal\n",
        "tried to catch Yanath's arm. But the madman avoided him and with froth flying from his lips, he drove\n",
        "his sword deep into Topal's body. Topal sank down with a groan, and Yanath whirled for an instant like\n",
        "a crazy dervish; then he ran at the shelves and began hacking at the glass with his sword, screeching\n",
        "blasphemously.\n",
        "Conan sprang at him from behind, trying to catch him unaware and disarm him, but the madman\n",
        "wheeled and lunged at him, screaming like a lost soul. Realizing that the warrior was hopelessly insane,\n",
        "the Cimmerian side-stepped, and as the maniac went past, he swung a cut that severed the shoulder-bone\n",
        "and breast, and dropped the man dead beside his dying victim.\n",
        "Conan bent over Topal, seeing that the man was at his last gasp. It was useless to seek to stanch the blood\n",
        "gushing from the horrible wound.\n",
        "\"You're done for, Topal,\" grunted Conan. \"Any word you want to send to your people?\"\n",
        "\"Bend closer,\" gasped Topal, and Conan complied--and an instant later caught the man's wrist as Topal\n",
        "struck at his breast with a dagger.\n",
        "\"Crom!\" swore Conan. \"Are you mad, too?\"\n",
        "\"Olmec ordered it!\" gasped the dying man. \"I know not why. As we lifted the wounded upon the couches\n",
        "he whispered to me, bidding me to slay you as we returned to Tecuhltli--\" And with the name of his clan\n",
        "on his lips, Topal died.\n",
        "Conan scowled down at him in puzzlement. This whole affair had an aspect of lunacy. Was Olmec mad,\n",
        "too? Were all the Tecuhltli madder than he had realized? With a shrug of his shoulders he strode down\n",
        "the hall and out of the bronze door, leaving the dead Tecuhltli lying before the staring dead eyes of their\n",
        "kinsmen's heads.\n",
        "Conan needed no guide back through the labyrinth they had traversed. His primitive instinct of direction\n",
        "led him unerringly along the route they had come. He traversed it as warily as he had before, his sword\n",
        "in his hand, and his eyes fiercely searching each shadowed nook and corner; for it was his former allies\n",
        "he feared now, not the ghosts of the slain Xotalancas.\n",
        "He had crossed the Great Hall and entered the chambers beyond when he heard something moving\n",
        "ahead of him--something which gasped and panted, and moved with a strange, floundering, scrambling\n",
        "noise. A moment later Conan saw a man crawling over the flaming floor toward him--a man whose\n",
        "progress left a broad bloody smear on the smoldering surface. It was Techotl and his eyes were already\n",
        "glazing; from a deep gash in his breast blood gushed steadily between the fingers of his clutching hand.\n",
        "With the other he clawed and hitched himself along.\n",
        "\"Conan,\" he cried chokingly, \"Conan! Olmec has taken the yellow-haired woman!\"\n",
        "\"So that's why he told Topal to kill me!\" murmured Conan, dropping to his knee beside the man, who his\n",
        "experienced eye told him was dying. \"Olmec isn't as mad as I thought.\"\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "443\n",
        "Techotl's groping fingers plucked at Conan's arm. In the cold, loveless, and altogether hideous life of the\n",
        "Tecuhltli, his admiration and affection for the invaders from the outer world formed a warm, human\n",
        "oasis, constituted a tie that connected him with a more natural humanity that was totally lacking in his\n",
        "fellows, whose only emotions were hate, lust, and the urge of sadistic cruelty.\n",
        "\"I sought to oppose him,\" gurgled Techotl, blood bubbling frothily to his lips. \"But he struck me down.\n",
        "He thought he had slain me, but I crawled away. Ah, Set, how far I have crawled in my own blood!\n",
        "Beware, Conan! Olmec may have set an ambush for your return! Slay Olmec! He is a beast. Take Valeria\n",
        "and flee! Fear not to traverse the forest. Olmec and Tascela lied about the dragons. They slew each other\n",
        "years ago, all save the strongest. For a dozen years there has been only one dragon. If you have slain him,\n",
        "there is naught in the forest to harm you. He was the god Olmec worshipped; and Olmec fed human\n",
        "sacrifices to him, the very old and the very young, bound and hurled from the wall. Hasten! Olmec has\n",
        "taken Valeria to the Chamber of the--\"\n",
        "His head slumped down and he was dead before it came to rest on the floor.\n",
        "Conan sprang up, his eyes like live coals. So that was Olmec's game, having first used the strangers to\n",
        "destroy his foes! He should have known that something of the sort would be going on in that blackbearded degenerate's mind.\n",
        "The Cimmerian started toward Tecuhltli with reckless speed. Rapidly he reckoned the numbers of his\n",
        "former allies. Only twenty-one, counting Olmec, had survived that fiendish battle in the throne room.\n",
        "Three had died since, which left seventeen enemies with which to reckon. In his rage Conan felt capable\n",
        "of accounting for the whole clan single-handed.\n",
        "But the innate craft of the wilderness rose to guide his berserk rage. He remembered Techotl's warning of\n",
        "an ambush. It was quite probable that the prince would make such provisions, on the chance that Topal\n",
        "might have failed to carry out his order. Olmec would be expecting him to return by the same route he\n",
        "had followed in going to Xotalanc.\n",
        "Conan glanced up at a skylight under which he was passing and caught the blurred glimmer of stars.\n",
        "They had not yet begun to pale for dawn. The events of the night had been crowded into a comparatively\n",
        "short space of time.\n",
        "He turned aside from his direct course and descended a winding staircase to the floor below. He did not\n",
        "know where the door was to be found that let into the castle on that level, but he knew he could find it.\n",
        "How he was to force the locks he did not know; he believed that the doors of Tecuhltli would all be\n",
        "locked and bolted, if for no other reason than the habits of half a century. But there was nothing else but\n",
        "to attempt it.\n",
        "Sword in hand, he hurried noiselessly on through a maze of green-lit or shadowy rooms and halls. He\n",
        "knew he must be near Tecuhltli, when a sound brought him up short. He recognized it for what it was--a\n",
        "human being trying to cry out through a stifling gag. It came from somewhere ahead of him, and to the\n",
        "left. In those deathly-still chambers a small sound carried a long way.\n",
        "Conan turned aside and went seeking after the sound, which continued to be repeated. Presently he was\n",
        "glaring through a doorway upon a weird scene. In the room into which he was looking a low rack-like\n",
        "frame of iron lay on the floor, and a giant figure was bound prostrate upon it. His head rested on a bed of \n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "444\n",
        "iron spikes, which were already crimson-pointed with blood where they had pierced his scalp. A peculiar\n",
        "harness-like contrivance was fastened about his head, though in such a manner that the leather band did\n",
        "not protect his scalp from the spikes. This harness was connected by a slender chain to the mechanism\n",
        "that upheld a huge iron ball which was suspended above the captive's hairy breast. As long as the man\n",
        "could force himself to remain motionless the iron ball hung in its place. But when the pain of the iron\n",
        "points caused him to lift his head, the ball lurched downward a few inches. Presently his aching neck\n",
        "muscles would no longer support his head in its unnatural position and it would fall back on the spikes\n",
        "again. It was obvious that eventually the ball would crush him to a pulp, slowly and inexorably. The\n",
        "victim was gagged, and above the gag his great black ox-eyes rolled wildly toward the man in the\n",
        "doorway, who stood in silent amazement. The man on the rack was Olmec, prince of Tecuhltli.\n",
        "The\n",
        "Eyes\n",
        "of\n",
        "Tascela\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Why did you bring me into this chamber to bandage my leg?\" demanded Valeria. \"Couldn't you have\n",
        "done it just as well in the throne room?\"\n",
        "She sat on a couch with her wounded leg extended upon it, and the Tecuhltli woman had just bound it\n",
        "with silk bandages. Valeria's red-stained sword lay on the couch beside her.\n",
        "She frowned as she spoke. The woman had done her task silently and efficiently, but Valeria liked neither\n",
        "the lingering, caressing touch of her slim fingers nor the expression in her eyes.\n",
        "\"They have taken the rest of the wounded into the other chambers,\" answered the woman in the soft\n",
        "speech of the Tecuhltli women, which somehow did not suggest either softness or gentleness in the\n",
        "speakers. A little while before, Valeria had seen this same woman stab a Xotalanca woman through the\n",
        "breast and stamp the eyeballs out of a wounded Xotalanca man.\n",
        "\"They will be carrying the corpses of the dead down into the catacombs,\" she added, \"lest the ghosts\n",
        "escape into the chambers and dwell there.\"\n",
        "\"Do you believe in ghosts?\" asked Valeria.\n",
        "\"I know the ghost of Tolkemec dwells in the catacombs,\" she answered with a shiver. \"Once I saw it, as I\n",
        "crouched in a crypt among the bones of a dead queen. It passed by in the form of an ancient man with\n",
        "flowing white beard and locks, and luminous eyes that blazed in the darkness. It was Tolkemec; I saw\n",
        "him living when I was a child and he was being tortured.\"\n",
        "Her voice sank to a fearful whisper: \"Olmec laughs, but I know Tolkemec's ghost dwells in the catacombs!\n",
        "They say it is rats which gnaw the flesh from the bones of the newly dead--but ghosts eat flesh. Who\n",
        "knows but that--\"\n",
        "She glanced up quickly as a shadow fell across the couch. Valeria looked up to see Olmec gazing down at\n",
        "her. The prince had cleansed his hands, torso, and beard of the blood that had splashed them; but he had\n",
        "not donned his robe, and his great dark-skinned hairless body and limbs renewed the impression of \n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "445\n",
        "strength bestial in its nature. His deep black eyes burned with a more elemental light, and there was the\n",
        "suggestion of a twitching in the fingers that tugged at his thick blue-black beard.\n",
        "He stared fixedly at the woman, and she rose and glided from the chamber. As she passed through the\n",
        "door she cast a look over her shoulder at Valeria, a glance full of cynical derision and obscene mockery.\n",
        "\"She has done a clumsy job,\" criticized the prince, coming to the divan and bending over the bandage.\n",
        "\"Let me see--\"\n",
        "With a quickness amazing in one of his bulk he snatched her sword and threw it across the chamber. His\n",
        "next move was to catch her in his giant arms.\n",
        "Quick and unexpected as the move was, she almost matched it; for even as he grabbed her, her dirk was\n",
        "in her hand and she stabbed murderously at his throat. More by luck than skill he caught her wrist, and\n",
        "then began a savage wrestling-match. She fought him with fists, feet, knees, teeth, and nails, with all the\n",
        "strength of her magnificent body and all the knowledge of hand-to-hand fighting she had acquired in her\n",
        "years of roving and fighting on sea and land. It availed her nothing against his brute strength. She lost her\n",
        "dirk in the first moment of contact, and thereafter found herself powerless to inflict any appreciable pain\n",
        "on her giant attacker.\n",
        "The blaze in his weird black eyes did not alter, and their expression filled her with fury, fanned by the\n",
        "sardonic smile that seemed carved upon his bearded lips. Those eyes and that smile contained all the\n",
        "cruel cynicism that seethes below the surface of a sophisticated and degenerate race, and for the first time\n",
        "in her life Valeria experienced fear of a man. It was like struggling against some huge elemental force; his\n",
        "iron arms thwarted her efforts with an ease that sent panic racing through her limbs. He seemed\n",
        "impervious to any pain she could inflict. Only once, when she sank her white teeth savagely into his wrist\n",
        "so that the blood started, did he react. And that was to buffet her brutally upon the side of the head with\n",
        "his open hand, so that stars flashed before her eyes and her head rolled on her shoulders.\n",
        "Her shirt had been torn open in the struggle, and with cynical cruelty he rasped his thick beard across her\n",
        "bare breasts, bringing the blood to suffuse the fair skin, and fetching a cry of pain and outraged fury from\n",
        "her. Her convulsive resistance was useless; she was crushed down on a couch, disarmed and panting, her\n",
        "eyes blazing up at him like the eyes of a trapped tigress.\n",
        "A moment later he was hurrying from the chamber, carrying her in his arms. She made no resistance, but\n",
        "the smoldering of her eyes showed that she was unconquered in spirit, at least. She had not cried out. She\n",
        "knew that Conan was not within call, and it did not occur to her that any in Tecuhltli would oppose their\n",
        "prince. But she noticed that Olmec went stealthily, with his head on one side as if listening for sounds of\n",
        "pursuit, and he did not return to the throne chamber. He carried her through a door that stood opposite\n",
        "that through which he had entered, crossed another room and began stealing down a hall. As she became\n",
        "convinced that he feared some opposition to the abduction, she threw back her head and screamed at the\n",
        "top of her lusty voice.\n",
        "She was rewarded by a slap that half-stunned her, and Olmec quickened his pace to a shambling run.\n",
        "But her cry had been echoed and, twisting her head about, Valeria, through the tears and stars that partly\n",
        "blinded her, saw Techotl limping after them.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "446\n",
        "Olmec turned with a snarl, shifting the woman to an uncomfortable and certainly undignified position\n",
        "under one huge arm, where he held her writhing and kicking vainly, like a child.\n",
        "\"Olmec!\" protested Techotl. \"You cannot be such a dog as to do this thing! She is Conan's woman! She\n",
        "helped us slay the Xotalancas, and--\"\n",
        "Without a word Olmec balled his free hand into a huge fist and stretched the wounded warrior senseless\n",
        "at his feet. Stooping, and hindered not at all by the struggles and imprecations of his captive, he drew\n",
        "Techotl's sword from its sheath and stabbed the warrior in the breast. Then casting aside the weapon, he\n",
        "fled on along the corridor. He did not see a woman's dark face peer cautiously after him from behind a\n",
        "hanging. It vanished, and presently Techotl groaned and stirred, rose dazedly and staggered drunkenly\n",
        "away, calling Conan's name.\n",
        "Olmec hurried on down the corridor, and descended a winding ivory staircase. He crossed several\n",
        "corridors and halted at last in a broad chamber whose doors were veiled with heavy tapestries, with one\n",
        "exception--a heavy bronze door similar to the Door of the Eagle on the upper floor.\n",
        "He was moved to rumble, pointing to it: \"That is one of the outer doors of Tecuhltli. For the first time in\n",
        "fifty years it is unguarded. We need not guard it now, for Xotalanc is no more.\"\n",
        "\"Thanks to Conan and me, you bloody rogue!\" sneered Valeria, trembling with fury and the shame of\n",
        "physical coercion. \"You treacherous dog! Conan will cut your throat for this!\"\n",
        "Olmec did not bother to voice his belief that Conan's own gullet had already been severed according to\n",
        "his whispered command. He was too utterly cynical to be at all interested in her thoughts or opinions.\n",
        "His flame-lit eyes devoured her, dwelling burningly on the generous expanses of clear white flesh\n",
        "exposed where her shirt and breeches had been torn in the struggle.\n",
        "\"Forget Conan,\" he said thickly. \"Olmec is lord of Xuchotl. Xotalanc is no more. There will be no more\n",
        "fighting. We shall spend our lives in drinking and love-making. First let us drink!\"\n",
        "He seated himself on an ivory table and pulled her down on his knees, like a dark-skinned satyr with a\n",
        "white nymph in his arms. Ignoring her un-nymphlike profanity, he held her helpless with one great arm\n",
        "about her waist while the other reached across the table and secured a vessel of wine.\n",
        "\"Drink!\" he commanded, forcing it to her lips, as she writhed her head away.\n",
        "The liquor slopped over, stinging her lips, splashing down on her naked breasts.\n",
        "\"Your guest does not like your wine, Olmec,\" spoke a cool, sardonic voice.\n",
        "Olmec stiffened; fear grew in his flaming eyes. Slowly he swung his great head about and stared at\n",
        "Tascela, who paused negligently in the curtained doorway, one hand on her smooth hip. Valeria twisted\n",
        "herself about in his iron grip, and when she met the burning eyes of Tascela, a chill tingled along her\n",
        "supple spine. New experiences were flooding Valeria's proud soul that night. Recently she had learned to\n",
        "fear a man; now she knew what it was to fear a woman.\n",
        "Olmec sat motionless, a gray pallor growing under his swarthy skin. Tascela brought her other hand from\n",
        "behind her and displayed a small gold vessel.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "447\n",
        "\"I feared she would not like your wine, Olmec,\" purred the princess, \"so I brought some of mine, some I\n",
        "brought with me long ago from the shores of Lake Zuad--do you understand, Olmec?\"\n",
        "Beads of sweat stood out suddenly on Olmec's brow. His muscles relaxed, and Valeria broke away and\n",
        "put the table between them. But though reason told her to dart from the room, some fascination she could\n",
        "not understand held her rigid, watching the scene.\n",
        "Tascela came toward the seated prince with a swaying, undulating walk that was mockery in itself. Her\n",
        "voice was soft, slurringly caressing, but her eyes gleamed. Her slim fingers stroked his beard lightly.\n",
        "\"You are selfish, Olmec,\" she crooned, smiling. \"You would keep our handsome guest to yourself, though\n",
        "you knew I wished to entertain her. You are much at fault, Olmec!\"\n",
        "The mask dropped for an instant; he eyes flashed, her face was contorted and with an appalling show of\n",
        "strength her hand locked convulsively in his beard and tore out a great handful. This evidence of\n",
        "unnatural strength was no more terrifying than the momentary baring of the hellish fury that raged\n",
        "under her bland exterior.\n",
        "Olmec lurched up with a roar, and stood swaying like a bear, his mighty hands clenching and\n",
        "unclenching.\n",
        "\"Slut!\" His booming voice filled the room. \"Witch! She-devil! Tecuhltli should have slain you fifty years\n",
        "ago! Begone! I have endured too much from you! This white-skinned wench is mine! Get hence before I\n",
        "slay you!\"\n",
        "The princess laughed and dashed the blood-stained strands into his face. Her laughter was less merciful\n",
        "than the ring of flint on steel.\n",
        "\"Once you spoke otherwise, Olmec,\" she taunted. \"Once, in your youth, you spoke words of love. Aye,\n",
        "you were my lover once, years ago, and because you loved me, you slept in my arms beneath the\n",
        "enchanted lotus--and thereby put into my hands the chains that enslaved you. You know you cannot\n",
        "withstand me. You know I have but to gaze into your eyes, with the mystic power a priest of Stygia\n",
        "taught me, long ago, and you are powerless. You remember the night beneath the black lotus that waved\n",
        "above us, stirred by no worldly breeze; you scent again the unearthly perfumes that stole and rose like a\n",
        "cloud about you to enslave you. You cannot fight against me. You are my slave as you were that night--as\n",
        "you shall be so long as you live, Olmec of Xuchotl!\"\n",
        "Her voice had sunk to a murmur like the rippling of a stream running through starlit darkness. She\n",
        "leaned close to the prince and spread her long tapering fingers upon his giant breast. His eyes glared, his\n",
        "great hands fell limply to his sides.\n",
        "With a smile of cruel malice, Tascela lifted the vessel and placed it to his lips.\n",
        "\"Drink!\"\n",
        "Mechanically the prince obeyed. And instantly the glaze passed from his eyes and they were flooded\n",
        "with fury, comprehension and an awful fear. His mouth gaped, but no sound issued. For an instant he\n",
        "reeled on buckling knees, and then fell in a sodden heap on the floor.\n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "448\n",
        "His fall jolted Valeria out of her paralysis. She turned and sprang toward the door, but with a movement\n",
        "that would have shamed a leaping panther, Tascela was before her. Valeria struck at her with her\n",
        "clenched fist, and all the power of her supple body behind the blow. It would have stretched a man\n",
        "senseless on the floor. But with a lithe twist of her torso, Tascela avoided the blow and caught the pirate's\n",
        "wrist. The next instant Valeria's left hand was imprisoned and, holding her wrists together with one hand,\n",
        "Tascela calmly bound them with a cord she drew from her girdle. Valeria thought she had tasted the\n",
        "ultimate in humiliation already that night, but her shame at being manhandled by Olmec was nothing to\n",
        "the sensations that now shook her supple frame. Valeria had always been inclined to despise the other\n",
        "members of her sex; and it was overwhelming to encounter another woman who could handle her like a\n",
        "child. She scarcely resisted at all when Tascela forced her into a chair and, drawing her bound wrists\n",
        "down between her knees, fastened them to the chair.\n",
        "Casually stepping over Olmec, Tascela walked to the bronze door and shot the bolt and threw it open,\n",
        "revealing a hallway without.\n",
        "\"Opening upon this hall,\" she remarked, speaking to her feminine captive for the first time, \"there is a\n",
        "chamber which in old times was used as a torture room. When we retired into Tecuhltli, we brought most\n",
        "of the apparatus with us, but there was one piece too heavy to move. It is still in working order. I think it\n",
        "will be quite convenient now.\"\n",
        "An understanding flame of terror rose in Olmec's eyes. Tascela strode back to him, bent and gripped him\n",
        "by the hair.\n",
        "\"He is only paralyzed temporarily,\" she remarked conversationally. \"He can hear, think, and feel--aye, he\n",
        "can feel very well indeed!\"\n",
        "With which sinister observation she started toward the door, dragging the giant bulk with an ease that\n",
        "made the pirate's eyes dilate. She passed into the hall and moved down it without hesitation, presently\n",
        "disappearing with her captive into a chamber that opened into it, and whence shortly thereafter issued\n",
        "the clank of iron.\n",
        "Valeria swore softly and tugged vainly, with her legs braced against the chair. The cords that confined\n",
        "her were apparently unbreakable.\n",
        "Tascela presently returned alone; behind her a muffled groaning issued from the chamber. She closed the\n",
        "door but did not bolt it. Tascela was beyond the grip of habit, as she was beyond the touch of other\n",
        "human instincts and emotions.\n",
        "Valeria sat dumbly, watching the woman in whose slim hands, the pirate realized, her destiny now rested.\n",
        "Tascela grasped her yellow locks and forced back her head, looking impersonably down into her face. But\n",
        "the glitter in her dark eyes was not impersonable.\n",
        "\"I have chosen you for a great honor,\" she said. \"You shall restore the youth of Tascela. Oh, you stare at\n",
        "that! My appearance is that of youth, but through my veins creeps the sluggish chill of approaching age,\n",
        "as I have felt it a thousand times before. I am old, so old I do not remember my childhood. But I was a girl\n",
        "once, and a priest of Stygia loved me, and gave me the secret of immortality and youth everlasting. He\n",
        "died, then--some said by poison. But I dwelt in my palace by the shores of Lake Zuad and the passing \n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "449\n",
        "years touched me not. So at last a king of Stygia desired me, and my people rebelled and brought me to\n",
        "this land. Olmec called me a princess. I am not of royal blood. I am greater than a princess. I am Tascela,\n",
        "whose youth your own glorious youth shall restore.\"\n",
        "Valeria's tongue clove to the roof of her mouth. She sensed here a mystery darker than the degeneracy\n",
        "she had anticipated.\n",
        "The taller woman unbound the Aquilonian's wrists and pulled her to her feet. It was not fear of the\n",
        "dominant strength that lurked in the princess' limbs that made Valeria a helpless, quivering captive in her\n",
        "hands. It was the burning, hypnotic, terrible eyes of Tascela.\n",

        "\"Well, I'm a Kushite!\"\n",
        "Conan glared down at the man on the iron rack.\n",
        "\"What the devil are you doing on that thing?\"\n",
        "Incoherent sounds issued from behind the gag and Conan bent and tore it away, evoking a bellow of fear\n",
        "from the captive; for his action caused the iron ball to lurch down until it nearly touched the broad breast.\n",
        "\"Be careful, for Set's sake!\" begged Olmec.\n",
        "\"What for?\" demanded Conan. \"Do you think I care what happens to you? I only wish I had time to stay\n",
        "here and watch that chunk of iron grind your guts out. But I'm in a hurry. Where's Valeria?\"\n",
        "\"Loose me!\" urged Olmec. \"I will tell you all!\"\n",
        "\"Tell me first.\"\n",
        "\"Never!\" The prince's heavy jaws set stubbornly.\n",
        "\"All right.\" Conan seated himself on a near-by bench. \"I'll find her myself, after you've been reduced to a\n",
        "jelly. I believe I can speed up that process by twisting my sword-point around in your ear,\" he added,\n",
        "extending the weapon experimentally.\n",
        "\"Wait!\" Words came in a rush from the captive's ashy lips. \"Tascela took her from me. I've never been\n",
        "anything but a puppet in Tascela's hands.\"\n",
        "\"Tascela?\" snorted Conan, and spat. \"Why, the filthy--\"\n",
        "\"No, no!\" panted Olmec. \"It's worse than you think. Tascela is old--centuries old. She renews her life and\n",
        "her youth by the sacrifice of beautiful young women. That's one thing that has reduced the clan to its\n",
        "present state. She will draw the essence of Valeria's life into her own body, and bloom with fresh vigor\n",
        "and beauty.\"\n",
        "\"Are the doors locked?\" asked Conan, thumbing his sword edge.\n",
        "\"Aye! But I know a way to get into Tecuhltli. Only Tascela and I know, and she thinks me helpless and\n",
        "you slain. Free me and I swear I will help you rescue Valeria. Without my help you cannot win into\n",
        "Tecuhltli; for even if you tortured me into revealing the secret, you couldn't work it. Let me go, and we\n",
        "will steal on Tascela and kill her before she can work magic--before she can fix her eyes on us. A knife\n",
        "thrown from behind will do the work. I should have killed her thus long ago, but I feared that without\n",
        "her to aid us the Xotalancas would overcome us. She needed my help, too; that's the only reason she let\n",
        "me live this long. Now neither needs the other, and one must die. I swear that when we have slain the\n",
        "witch, you and Valeria shall go free without harm. My people will obey me when Tascela is dead.\"\n",

        "Conan stooped and cut the ropes that held the prince, and Olmec slid cautiously from under the great\n",
        "ball and rose, shaking his head like a bull and muttering imprecations as he fingered his lacerated scalp.\n",
        "Standing shoulder to shoulder the two men presented a formidable picture of primitive power. Olmec\n",

        "stairs wind down to the various chambers. Hasten!\"\n",
        "\"After you, comrade!\" retorted Conan satirically, swaying his broadsword as he spoke, and Olmec\n",
        "shrugged his shoulders and stepped onto the staircase. Conan instantly followed him, and the door shut\n",
        "behind them. Far above a cluster of fire-jewels made the staircase a well of dusky dragon-light.\n",
        "They mounted until Conan estimated that they were above the level of the fourth floor, and then came\n",
        "out into a cylindrical tower, in the domed roof of which was set the bunch of fire-jewels that lighted the\n",
        "stair. Through gold-barred windows, set with unbreakable crystal panes, the first windows he had seen\n",
        "in Xuchotl, Conan got a glimpse of high ridges, domes and more towers, looming darkly against the stars.\n",
        "He was looking across the roofs of Xuchotl.\n",
        "Olmec did not look through the windows. He hurried down one of the several stairs that wound down\n",
        "from the tower, and when they had descended a few feet, this stair changed into a narrow corridor that\n",
        "wound tortuously on for some distance. It ceased at a steep flight of steps leading downward. There\n",

        "In the swift rage roused by that cry, and the amazement of wondering what peril could wring such a\n",
        "shriek from Valeria's reckless lips, Conan forgot Olmec. He pushed past the prince and started down the\n",
        "stair. Awakening instinct brought him about again, just as Olmec strruck with his great mallet-like fist.\n",
        "The blow, fierce and silent, was aimed at the base of Conan's brain. But the Cimmerian wheeled in time to\n",
        "receive the buffet on the side of his neck instead. The impact would have snapped the vertebrae of a\n",
        "lesser man. As it was, Conan swayed backward, but even as he reeled he dropped his sword, useless at\n",
        "such close quarters, and grasped Olmec's extended arm, dragging the prince with him as he fell.\n",
        "Headlong they went down the steps together, in a revolving whirl of limbs and heads and bodies. And as\n",
        "they went, Conan's iron fingers found and locked in Olmec's bull-throat.\n",
        "The barbarian's neck and shoulder felt numb from the sledge-like impact of Olmec's huge fist, which had\n",
        "carried all the strength of the massive forearm, thick triceps and great shoulder. But this did not affect his\n",
        "ferocity to any appreciable extent. Like a bulldog he hung on grimly, rolled, until at last they struck an\n",
        "ivory panel-door at the bottom with such and impact that they splintered it its full length and crashed\n",
        "through its ruins. But Olmec was already dead, for those iron fingers had crushed out his life and broken\n",
        "his neck as they fell.\n",
        "Conan rose, shaking the splinters from his great shoulders, blinking blood and dust out of his eyes.\n",
        "He was in the great throne room. There were fifteen people in that room besides himself. The first person\n",
        "he saw was Valeria. A curious black altar stood before the throne-dais. Ranged about it, seven black\n",
        "candles in golden candlesticks sent up oozing spirals of thick green smoke, disturbingly scented. These\n",
        "spirals united in a cloud near the ceiling, forming a smoky arch above the altar. On that altar lay Valeria,\n",
        "stark naked, her white flesh gleaming in shocking contrast to the glistening ebon stone. She was not\n",
        "bound. She lay at full length, her arms stretched out above her head to their fullest extent. At the head of\n",
        "the altar knelt a young man, holding her wrists firmly. A young woman knelt at the other end of the altar,\n",
        "grasping her ankles. Between them she could neither rise nor move.\n",
        "Eleven men and women of Tecuhltli knelt dumbly in a semicircle, watching the scene with hot, lustful\n",
        "eyes.\n",
        "On the ivory throne-seat Tascela lolled. Bronze bowls of incense rolled their spirals about her; the wisps\n",
        "of smoke curled about her naked limbs like caressing fingers. She could not sit still; she squirmed and\n",
        "shifted about with sensuous abandon, as if finding pleasure in the contact of the smooth ivory with her\n",
        "sleek flesh.\n",
        "The crash of the door as it broke beneath the impact of the hurtling bodies caused no change in the scene.\n",
        "The kneeling men and women merely glanced incuriously at the corpse of their prince and at the man\n",
        "who rose from the ruins of the door, then swung their eyes greedily back to the writhing white shape on\n",
        "the black altar. Tascela looked insolently at him, and sprawled back on her seat, laughing mockingly.\n",
        "\"Slut!\" Conan saw red. His hands clenched into iron hammers as he started for her. With his first step\n",
        "something clanged loudly and steel bit savagely into his leg. He stumbled and almost fell, checked in his\n",
        "headlong stride. The jaws of an iron trap had closed on his leg, with teeth that sank deep and held. Only \n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "453\n",
        "the ridged muscles of his calf saved the bone from being splintered. The accursed thing had sprung out of\n",
        "the smoldering floor without warning. He saw the slots now, in the floor where the jaws had lain,\n",
        "perfectly camouflaged.\n",
        "\"Fool!\" laughed Tascela. \"Did you think I would not guard against your possible return? Every door in\n",
        "this chamber is guarded by such traps. Stand there and watch now, while I fulfill the destiny of your\n",
        "handsome friend! Then I will decide your own.\"\n",
        "Conan's hand instinctively sought his belt, only to encounter an empty scabbard. His sword was on the\n",
        "stair behind him. His poniard was lying back in the forest, where the dragon had torn it from his jaw. The\n",
        "steel teeth in his leg were like burning coals, but the pain was not as savage as the fury that seethed in his\n",
        "soul. He was trapped, like a wolf. If he had had his sword he would have hewn off his leg and crawled\n",
        "across the floor to slay Tascela. Valeria's eyes rolled toward him with mute appeal, and his own\n",
        "helplessness sent red waves of madness surging through his brain.\n",
        "Dropping on the knee of his free leg, he strove to get his fingers between the jaws of the trap, to tear them\n",
        "apart by sheer strength. Blood started from beneath his fingernails, but the jaws fitted close about his leg\n",
        "in a circle whose segments jointed perfectly, contracted until there was no space between his mangled\n",
        "flesh and the fanged iron. The site of Valeria's naked body added flame to the fire of his rage.\n",
        "Tascela ignored him. Rising languidly from her seat she swept the ranks of her subjects with a searching\n",
        "glance, and asked: \"Where are Xamec, Zlanath and Tachic?\"\n",
        "\"They did not return from the catacombs, princess,\" answered a man. \"Like the rest of us, they bore\n",
        "bodies of the slain into the crypts, but they have not returned. Perhaps the ghost of Tolkemec took them.\"\n",
        "\"Be silent, fool!\" she ordered harshly. \"The ghost is a myth.\"\n",
        "She came down from her dais, playing with a thin gold-hilted dagger. Her eyes burned like nothing on\n",
        "the hither side of hell. She paused beside the altar and spoke in the tense stillness.\n",
        "\"Your life shall make me young, white woman!\" she said. \"I shall lean upon your bosom and place my\n",
        "lips over yours, and slowly--ah, slowly!--sink this blade through your heart, so that your life, fleeing your\n",
        "stiffening body, shall enter mine, making me bloom again with youth and with life everlasting!\"\n",
        "Slowly, like a serpent arching toward its victim, she bent down through the writhing smoke, closer and\n",
        "closer over the now motionless woman who stared up into her glowing dark eyes--eyes that grew larger\n",
        "and deeper, blazing like black moons in the swirling smoke.\n",
        "The kneeling people gripped their hands and held their breath, tense for the bloody climax, and the only\n",
        "sound was Conan's fierce panting as he strove to tear his leg from the trap.\n",
        "All eyes were glued on the altar and the white figure there; the crash of a thunderbolt could hardly have\n",
        "broken the spell, yet it was only a low cry that shattered the fixity of the scene and bought all whirling\n",
        "about--a low cry, yet one to make the hair stand up stiffly on the scalp. They looked, and they saw.\n",
        "Framed in the door to the left of the dais stood a nightmare figure. It was a man, with a tangle of white\n",
        "hair and a matted white beard that fell over his breast. Rags only partly covered his gaunt frame,\n",
        "revealing half-naked limbs strangely unnatural in appearance. The skin was not like that of a normal \n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "454\n",
        "human. There was a suggestion of scaliness about it, as if the owner had dwelt long under conditions\n",
        "almost antithetical to those conditions under which human life ordinarily thrives. And there was nothing\n",
        "at all human about the eyes that blazed from the tangle of white hair. They were great gleaming disks\n",
        "that started unwinkingly, luminous, whitish, and without a hint of normal emotion or sanity. The mouth\n",
        "gaped, but no coherent words issued--only a high-pitched tittering.\n",
        "\"Tolkemec!\" whispered Tascela, livid, while the others crouched in speechless horror. \"No myth, then, no\n",
        "ghost! Set! You have dwelt for twelve years in darkness! Twelve years among the bones of the dead!\n",
        "What grisly food did you find? What mad travesty of life did you live, in the stark blackness of that\n",
        "eternal night? I see now why Xamec and Zlanath and Tachic did not return from the catacombs--and\n",
        "never will return. But why have you waited so long to strike? Were you seeking something, in the pits?\n",
        "Some secret weapon you knew was hidden there? And have you found it at last?\"\n",
        "That hideous tittering was Tolkemec's only reply, as he bounded into the room with a long leap that\n",
        "carried him over the secret trap before the door--by chance, or by some faint recollection of the ways of\n",
        "Xuchotl. He was not mad, as a man is mad. He had dwelt apart from humanity so long that he was no\n",
        "longer human. Only an unbroken thread of memory embodied in hate and the urge for vengeance had\n",
        "connected him with the humanity from which he had been cut off, and held him lurking near the people\n",
        "he hated. Only that thin string had kept him from racing and prancing off for ever into the black corridors\n",
        "and realms of the subterranean world he had discovered, long ago.\n",
        "\"You sought something hidden!\" whispered Tascela, cringing back. \"And you have found it! You\n",
        "remember the feud! After all these years of blackness, you remember!\"\n",
        "For in the lean hand of Tolkemec now waved a curious jade-hued wand, on the end of which glowed a\n",
        "knob of crimson shaped like a pomegranate. She sprang aside as he thrust it out like a spear, and a beam\n",
        "of crimson fire lanced from the pomegranate. It missed Tascela, but the woman holding Valeria's ankles\n",
        "was in the way. It smote between her shoulders. There was a sharp crackling sound and the ray of fire\n",
        "flashed from her bosom and struck the black altar, with a snapping of blue sparks. The woman toppled\n",
        "sidewise, shriveling and withering like a mummy even as she fell.\n",
        "Valeria rolled from the altar on the other side, and started for the opposite wall on all fours. For hell had\n",
        "burst loose in the throne room of dead Olmec.\n",
        "The man who had held Valeria's hands was the next to die. He turned to run, but before he had taken half\n",
        "a dozen steps, Tolkemec, with an agility appalling in such a frame, bounded around to a position that\n",
        "placed the man between him and the altar. Again the red fire-beam flashed and the Tecuhltli rolled\n",
        "lifeless to the floor, as the beam completed its course with a burst of blue sparks against the altar.\n",
        "Then began the slaughter. Screaming insanely the people rushed about the chamber, caroming from one\n",
        "another, stumbling and falling. And among them Tolkemec capered and pranced, dealing death. They\n",
        "could not escape by the doors; for apparently the metal of the portals served like the metal veined stone\n",

        "the ancient waved in his hand. When he caught a man or a woman between him and a door or the altar,\n",
        "that one died instantly. He chose no special victim. He took them as they came, with his rags flapping\n",
        "about his wildly gyrating limbs, and the gusty echoes of his tittering sweeping the room above the\n",
        "screams. And bodies fell like falling leaves about the altar and at the doors. One warrior in desperation \n",
        "Red Nails\n",
        "455\n",
        "rushed at him, lifting a dagger, only to fall before he could strike. But the rest were like crazed cattle, with\n",
        "no thought for resistance, and no chance of escape.\n",
        "The last Tecuhltli except Tascela had fallen when the princess reached the Cimmerian and the girl who\n",
        "had taken refuge beside him. Tascela bent and touched the floor, pressing a design upon it. Instantly the\n",
        "iron jaws released the bleeding limb and sank back into the floor.\n",
        "\"Slay him if you can!\" she panted, and pressed a heavy knife into his hand. \"I have no magic to withstand\n",

        "With a grunt he sprang before the woman, not heeding his lacerated leg in the heat of the fighting lust.\n",
        "Tolkemec was coming toward him, his weird eyes ablaze, but he hesitated at the gleam of the knife in\n",
        "Conan's hand. Then began a grim game, as Tolkemec sought to circle about Conan and get the barbarian\n",
        "between him and the altar or a metal door, while Conan sought to avoid this and drive home his knife.\n",
        "The women watched tensely, holding their breath.\n",
        "There was no sound except the rustle and scrape of quick-shifting feet. Tolkemec pranced and capered no\n",
        "more. He realized that grimmer game confronted him than the people who had died screaming and\n",
        "fleeing. In the elemental blaze of the barbarian's eyes he read an intent deadly as his own. Back and forth\n",
        "they weaved, and when one moved the other moved as if invisible threads bound them together. But all\n",
        "the time Conan was getting closer and closer to his enemy. Already the coiled muscles of his thighs were\n",
        "beginning to flex for a spring, when Valeria cried out. For a fleeting instant a bronze door was in line with\n",
        "Conan's moving body. The red line leaped, searing Conan's flank as he twisted aside, and even as he\n",
        "shifted he hurled the knife. Old Tolkemec went down, truly slain at last, the hilt vibrating on his breast.\n",
        "Tascela sprang--not toward Conan, but toward the wand where it shimmered like a live thing on the floor.\n",
        "But as she leaped, so did Valeria, with a dagger snatched from a dead man; and the blade, driven with all\n",
        "the power of the pirate's muscles, impaled the princess of Tecuhltli so that the point stood out between\n",
        "her breasts. Tascela screamed once and fell dead, and Valeria spurned the body with her heel as it fell.\n",
        "\"I had to do that much, for my own self-respect!\" panted Valeria, facing Conan across the limp corpse.\n",
        "\"Well, this cleans up the feud,\" he grunted. \"It's been a hell of a night! Where did these people keep their\n",
        "food? I'm hungry.\"\n",
        "\"You need a bandage on that leg.\" Valeria ripped a length of silk from a hanging and knotted it about her\n",
        "waist, then tore off some smaller strips which she bound efficiently about the barbarian's lacerated limb.\n",
        "\"I can walk on it,\" he assured her. \"Let's begone. It's dawn, outside this infernal city. I've had enough of\n",

        "You doubted me--but I have not failed! We have been close to the open gates of hell this night, and the\n",
        "shapes of darkness have gathered close about us---aye, they followed him to the very door--but we have\n",
        "brought the great magician back to life.\"\n",
        "\"And damned our souls to purgatories everlasting, I doubt not,\" muttered the small, dark man, Tarascus.\n",
        "The yellow-haired man, Valerius, laughed harshly.\n",
        "\"What purgatory can be worse than life itself? So we are all damned together from birth. Besides, who\n",
        "would not sell his miserable soul for a throne?\"\n",
        "\"There is no intelligence in his stare, Orastes,\" said the large man.\n",
        "\"He has long been dead,\" answered Orastes. \"He is as one newly awakened. His mind is empty after the\n",
        "long sleep--nay, he was dead, not sleeping. We brought his spirit back over the voids and gulfs of night\n",
        "and oblivion. I will speak to him.\"\n",
        "He bent over the foot of the sarcophagus, and fixing his gaze on the wide dark eyes of the man within, he\n",
        "said, slowly: \"Awake, Xaltotun!\"\n",
        "The lips of the man moved mechanically. \"Xaltotun!\" he repeated in a groping whisper.\n",
        "\"You are Xaltotun!\" exclaimed Orastes, like a hypnotist driving home his suggestions. \"You are Xaltotun\n",
        "of Python, in Acheron.\"\n",
        "A dim flame flickered in the dark eyes.\n",
        "\"I was Xaltotun,\" he whispered. \"I am dead.\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "459\n",
        "\"You are Xaltotun!\" cried Orastes. \"You are not dead! You live!\"\n",
        "\"I am Xaltotun,\" came the eery whisper. \"But I am dead. In my house in Khemi, in Stygia, there I died.\"\n",
        "\"And the priests who poisoned you mummified your body with their dark arts, keeping all your organs\n",
        "intact!\" exclaimed Orastes. \"But now you live again! The Heart of Ahriman has restored your life, drawn\n",
        "your spirit back from space and eternity.\"\n",
        "\"The Heart of Ahriman!\" The flame of remembrance grew stronger. \"The barbarians stole it from me!\"\n",
        "\"He remembers,\" muttered Orastes. \"Lift him from the case.\"\n",
        "The others obeyed hesitantly, as if reluctant to touch the man they had re-created, and they seemed not\n",
        "easier in their minds when they felt firm muscular flesh, vibrant with blood and life, beneath their fingers.\n",
        "But they lifted him upon the table, and Orastes clothed him in a curious dark velvet robe, splashed with\n",
        "gold stars and crescent moons, and fastened a cloth-of-gold fillet about his temples, confining the black\n",
        "wavy locks that fell to his shoulders. He let them do as they would, saying nothing, not even when they\n",
        "set him in a carven thronelike chair with a high ebony back and wide silver arms, and feet like golden\n",
        "claws. He sat there motionless, and slowly intelligence grew in his dark eyes and made them deep and\n",
        "strange and luminous. It was as if long-sunken witch-lights floated slowly up through midnight pools of\n",
        "darkness.\n",
        "Orastes cast a furtive glance at his companions, who stood staring in morbid fascination at their strange\n",
        "guest. Their iron nerves had withstood an ordeal that might have driven weaker men mad. He knew it\n",
        "was with no weaklings that he conspired, but men whose courage was as profound as their lawless\n",
        "ambitions and capacity for evil. He turned his attention to the figure in the ebon-black chair. And this one\n",
        "spoke at last.\n",
        "\"I remember,\" he said in a strong, resonant voice, speaking Nemedian with a curious, archaic accent. \"I\n",
        "am Xaltotun, who was high priest of Set in Python, which was in Acheron. The Heart of Ahriman--I\n",
        "dreamed I had found it again--where is it?\"\n",
        "Orastes placed it in his hand, and he drew breath deeply as he gazed into the depths of the terrible jewel\n",
        "burning in his grasp.\n",
        "\"They stole it from me, long ago,\" he said. \"The red heart of the night it is, strong to save or to damn. It\n",
        "came from afar, and from long ago. While I held it, none could stand before me. But it was stolen from me,\n",
        "and Acheron fell, and I fled an exile into dark Stygia. Much I remember, but much I have forgotten. I\n",
        "have been in a far land, across misty voids and gulfs and unlit oceans. What is the year?\"\n",
        "Orastes answered him. \"It is the waning of the Year of the Lion, three thousand years after the fall of\n",
        "Acheron.\"\n",
        "\"Three thousand years!\" murmured the other. \"So long? Who are you?\"\n",
        "\"I am Orastes, once a priest of Mitra. This man is Amalric, baron of Tor, in Nemedia; this other is Tarascus,\n",
        "younger brother of the king of Nemedia; and this tall man is Valerius, rightful heir of the throne of\n",
        "Aquilonia.\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "460\n",
        "\"Why have you given me life?\" demanded Xaltotun. \"What do you require of me?\"\n",
        "The man was now fully alive and awake, his keen eyes reflecting the working of an unclouded brain.\n",
        "There was no hesitation or uncertainty in his manner. He came directly to the point, as one who knows\n",
        "that no man gives something for nothing. Orastes met him with equal candor.\n",
        "\"We have opened the doors of hell this night to free your soul and return it to your body because we need\n",
        "your aid. We wish to place Tarascus on the throne of Nemedia, and to win for Valerius the crown of\n",
        "Aquilonia. With your necromancy you can aid us.\"\n",
        "Xaltotun's mind was devious and full of unexpected slants.\n",
        "\"You must be deep in the arts yourself, Orastes, to have been able to restore my life. How is it that a priest\n",
        "of Mitra knows of the Heart of Ahriman, and the incantations of Skelos?\"\n",
        "\"I am no longer a priest of Mitra,\" answered Orastes. \"I was cast forth from my order because of my\n",
        "delving in black magic. But for Amalric there I might have been burned as a magician.\n",
        "\"But that left me free to pursue my studies. I journeyed in Zamora, in Vendhya, in Stygia, and among the\n",
        "haunted jungles of Khitai. I read the iron-bound books of Skelos, and talked with unseen creatures in\n",
        "deep wells, and faceless shapes in black reeking jungles. I obtained a glimpse of your sarcophagus in the\n",
        "demon-haunted crypts below the black giant-walled temple of Set in the hinterlands of Stygia, and I\n",
        "learned of the arts that would bring back life to your shriveled corpse. From moldering manuscripts I\n",
        "learned of the Heart of Ahriman. Then for a year I sought its hiding-place, and at last I found it.\"\n",
        "\"Then why trouble to bring me back to life?\" demanded Xaltotun, with his piercing gaze fixed on the\n",
        "priests. \"Why did you not employ the Heart to further your own power?\"\n",
        "\"Because no man today knows the secrets of the Heart,\" answered Orastes. \"Not even in legends live the\n",
        "arts by which to loose its full powers. I knew it could restore life; of its deeper secrets I am ignorant. I\n",
        "merely used it to bring you back to life. It is the use of your knowledge we seek. As for the Heart, you\n",
        "alone know its awful secrets.\"\n",
        "Xaltotun shook his head, staring broodingly into the flaming depths.\n",
        "\"My necromantic knowledge is greater than the sum of all the knowledge of other men,\" he said; \"yet I do\n",
        "not know the full power of the jewel. I did not invoke it in the old days; I guarded it lest it be used against\n",
        "me. At last it was stolen, and in the hands of a feathered shaman of the barbarians it defeated all my\n",
        "mighty sorcery. Then it vanished, and I was poisoned by the jealous priests of Stygia before I could learn\n",
        "where it was hidden.\"\n",
        "\"It was hidden in a cavern below the temple of Mitra, in Tarantia,\" said Orastes. \"By devious ways I\n",
        "discovered this, after I had located your remains in Set's subterranean temple in Stygia.\n",
        "\"Zamorian thieves, partly protected by spells I learned from sources better left unmentioned, stole your\n",
        "mummy-case from under the very talons of those which guarded it in the dark, and by camel-caravan\n",
        "and galley and ox-wagon it came at last to this city.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "461\n",
        "\"Those same thieves--or rather those of them who still lived after their frightful quest--stole the Heart of\n",
        "Ahriman from its haunted cavern below the temple of Mitra, and all the skill of men and the spells of\n",
        "sorcerers nearly failed. One man of them lived long enough to reach me and give the jewel into my hands,\n",
        "before he died slavering and gibbering of what he had seen in that accursed crypt. The thieves of Zamora\n",
        "are the most faithful of men to their trust. Even with my conjurements, none but them could have stolen\n",
        "the Heart from where it has lain in demon-guarded darkness since the fall of Acheron, three thousand\n",
        "years ago.\"\n",
        "Xaltotun lifted his lionlike head and stared far off into space, as if plumbing the lost centuries.\n",
        "\"Three thousand years!\" he muttered. \"Set! Tell me what has chanced in the world.\"\n",
        "\"The barbarians who overthrew Acheron set up new kingdoms,\" quoted Orastes. \"Where the empire had\n",
        "stretched now rose realms called Aquilonia, and Nemedia, and Argos, from the tribes that founded them.\n",
        "The older kingdoms of Ophir, Corinthia and western Koth, which had been subject to the kings of\n",
        "Acheron, regained their independence with the fall of the empire.\"\n",
        "\"And what of the people of Acheron?\" demanded Orastes. \"When I fled into Stygia, Python was in ruins,\n",
        "and all the great, purple-towered cities of Acheron fouled with blood and trampled by the sandals of the\n",
        "barbarians.\"\n",
        "\"In the hills small groups of folk still boast descent from Acheron,\" answered Orastes. \"For the rest, the\n",
        "tide of my barbarian ancestors rolled over them and wiped them out. They--my ancestors--had suffered\n",
        "much from the kings of Acheron.\"\n",
        "A grim and terrible smile curled the Pythonian's lips.\n",
        "\"Aye! Many a barbarian, both man and woman, died screaming on the altar under this hand. I have seen\n",
        "their heads piled to make a pyramid in the great square in Python when the kings returned from the west\n",
        "with their spoils and naked captives.\"\n",
        "\"Aye. And when the day of reckoning came, the sword was not spared. So Acheron ceased to be, and\n",
        "purple-towered Python became a memory of forgotten days. But the younger kingdoms rose on the\n",
        "imperial ruins and waxed great. And now we have brought you back to aid us to rule these kingdoms,\n",
        "which, if less strange and wonderful than Acheron of old, are yet rich and powerful, well worth fighting\n",
        "for. Look!\" Orastes unrolled before the stranger a map drawn cunningly on vellum.\n",
        "Xaltotun regarded it, and then shook his head, baffled.\n",
        "\"The very outlines of the land are changed. It is like some familiar thing seen in a dream, fantastically\n",
        "distorted.\"\n",
        "\"Howbeit,\" answered Orastes, tracing with his forefinger, \"here is Belverus, the capital of Nemedia, in\n",
        "which we now are. Here run the boundaries of the land of Nemedia. To the south and southeast are\n",
        "Ophir and Corinthia, to the east Brythunia, to the west Aquilonia.\"\n",
        "\"It is the map of a world I do not know,\" said Xaltotun softly, but Orastes did not miss the lurid fire of\n",
        "hate that flickered in his dark eyes.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "462\n",
        "\"It is a map you shall help us change,\" answered Orastes. \"It is our desire first to set Tarascus on the\n",
        "throne of Nemedia. We wish to accomplish this without strife, and in such a way that no suspicion will\n",
        "rest on Tarascus. We do not wish the land to be torn by civil wars, but to reserve all our power for the\n",
        "conquest of Aquilonia.\n",
        "\"Should King Nimed and his sons die naturally, in a plague for instance, Tarascus would mount the\n",
        "throne as the next heir, peacefully and unopposed.\"\n",
        "Xaltotun nodded, without replying, and Orastes continued.\n",
        "\"The other task will be more difficult. We cannot set Valerius on the Aquilonian throne without a war,\n",
        "and that kingdom is a formidable foe. Its people are a hardy, warlike race, toughened by continual wars\n",
        "with the Picts, Zingarians and Cimmerians. For five hundred years Aquilonia and Nemedia have\n",
        "intermittently waged war, and the ultimate advantage has always lain with the Aquilonians.\n",
        "\"Their present king is the most renowned warrior among the western nations. He is an outlander, an\n",
        "adventurer who seized the crown by force during a time of civil strife, strangling King Namedides with\n",
        "his own hands, upon the very throne. His name is Conan, and no man can stand before him in battle.\n",
        "\"Valerius is now the rightful heir of the throne. He had been driven into exile by his royal kinsman,\n",
        "Namedides, and has been away from his native realm for years, but he is of the blood of the old dynasty,\n",
        "and many of the barons would secretly hail the overthrow of Conan, who is a nobody without royal or\n",
        "even noble blood. But the common people are loyal to him, and the nobility of the outlying provinces. Yet\n",
        "if his forces were overthrown in the battle that must first take place, and Conan himself slain, I think it\n",
        "would not be difficult to put Valerius on the throne. Indeed, with Conan slain, the only center of the\n",
        "government would be gone. He is not part of a dynasty, but only a lone adventurer.\"\n",
        "\"I wish that I might see this king,\" mused Xaltotun, glancing toward a silvery mirror which formed one of\n",
        "the panels of the wall. This mirror cast no reflection, but Xaltotun's expression showed that he\n",
        "understood its purpose, and Orastes nodded with the pride a good craftsman takes in the recognition of\n",
        "his accomplishments by a master of his craft.\n",
        "\"I will try to show him to you,\" he said. And seating himself before the mirror, he gazed hypnotically into\n",
        "its depths, where presently a dim shadow began to take shape.\n",
        "It was uncanny, but those watching knew it was no more than the reflected image of Orastes' thought,\n",
        "embodied in that mirror as a wizard's thoughts are embodied in a magic crystal. It floated hazily, then\n",
        "leaped into startling clarity--a tall man, mightily shouldered and deep of chest, with a massive corded\n",
        "neck and heavily muscled limbs. He was clad in silk and velvet, with the royal lions of Aquilonia worked\n",
        "in gold upon his rich jupon, and the crown of Aquilonia shone on his square-cut black mane; but the\n",
        "great sword at his side seemed more natural to him than the regal accouterments. His brow was low and\n",
        "broad, his eyes a volcanic blue that smoldered as if with some inner fire. His dark, scarred, almost sinister\n",
        "face was that of a fighting- man, and his velvet garments could not conceal the hard, dangerous lines of\n",
        "his limbs.\n",
        "\"That man is no Hyborian!\" exclaimed Xaltotun.\n",
        "\"No; he is a Cimmerian, one of those wild tribesmen who dwell in the gray hills of the north.\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "463\n",
        "\"I fought his ancestors of old,\" muttered Xaltotun. \"Not even the kings of Acheron could conquer them.\"\n",
        "\"They still remain a terror to the nations of the south,\" answered Orastes. \"He is a true son of that savage\n",
        "race, and has proved himself, thus far, unconquerable.\"\n",
        "Xaltotun did not reply; he sat staring down at the pool of living fire that shimmered in his hand. Outside,\n",

        "punishment for the sins of pride and lust. It was swift and deadly as the stroke of an adder. The victim's\n",
        "body turned purple and then black, and within a few minutes he sank down dying, and the stench of his\n",
        "own putrefaction was in his nostrils even before death wrenched his soul from his rotting body. A hot,\n",
        "roaring wind blew incessantly from the south, and the crops withered in the fields, the cattle sank and\n",

        "Men cried out on Mitra, and muttered against the king; for somehow, throughout the kingdom, the word\n",

        "That night, just before dawn, the hot wind that had blown for weeks ceased to rustle evilly through the\n",
        "silken window curtains. Out of the north rose a great wind that roared among the towers, and there was\n",
        "cataclysmic thunder, and blinding sheets of lightning, and driving rain. But the dawn shone clean and\n",
        "green and clear; the scorched ground veiled itself in grass, the thirsty crops sprang up anew, and the\n",
        "plague was gone--its miasma swept clean out of the land by the mighty wind.\n",
        "Men said the gods were satisfied because the evil king and his spawn were slain, and when his young\n",
        "brother Tarascus was crowned in the great coronation hall, the populace cheered until the towers rocked,\n",
        "acclaiming the monarch on whom the gods smiled.\n",
        "Such a wave of enthusiasm and rejoicing as swept the land is frequently the signal for a war of conquest.\n",
        "So no one was surprized when it was announced that King Tarascus had declared the truce made by the\n",

        "was candid; his motives, loudly proclaimed, gilded his actions with something of the glamour of a\n",

        "unheeded in the general wave of fervor and zeal of Tarascus' popularity. If any shrewd individuals\n",

        "leather jerkins. They crossed the border, took a frontier castle and burned three mountain villages, and\n",
        "then, in the valley of the Valkia, ten miles west of the boundary line, they met the hosts of Conan, king of\n",
        "Aquilonia--forty-five thousand knights, archers and men-at-arms, the flower of Aquilonian strength and\n",

        "he shook his head.\n",
        "\"There is no one here, sire. You sleep in the midst of your host.\"\n",
        "\"I have seen death strike a king in the midst of thousands,\" muttered Conan. \"Something that walks on\n",
        "invisible feet and is not seen--\"\n",
        "\"Perhaps you were dreaming, Your Majesty,\" said Pallantides, somewhat perturbed.\n",
        "\"So I was,\" grunted Conan. \"A devilish dream it was, too. I trod again all the long, weary roads I traveled\n",
        "on my way to the kingship.\"\n",
        "He fell silent, and Pallantides stared at him unspeaking. The. king was an enigma to the general, as to\n",
        "most of his civilized subjects. Pallantides knew that Conan had walked many strange roads in his wild,\n",
        "eventful life, and had been many things before a twist of Fate set him on the throne of Aquilonia.\n",
        "\"I saw again in the battlefield whereon I was born,\" said Conan, resting his chin moodily on a massive fist.\n",
        "\"I saw myself in a pantherskin loin-clout, throwing my spear at the mountain beasts. I was a mercenary\n",
        "swordsman again, a hetman of the kozaki who dwell along the Zaporoska River, a corsair looting the\n",
        "coasts of Kush, a pirate of the Barachan Isles, a chief of the Himelian hillmen. All these things I've been,\n",
        "and of all these things I dreamed; all the shapes that have been I passed like an endless procession, and\n",
        "their feet beat out a dirge in the sounding dust.\n",
        "\"But throughout my dreams moved strange, veiled figures and ghostly shadows, and a far-away voice\n",
        "mocked me. And toward the last I seemed to see myself lying on this dais in my tent, and a shape bent\n",
        "over me, robed and hooded. I lay unable to move, and then the hood fell away and a moldering skull\n",
        "grinned down at me. Then it was that I awoke.\"\n",
        "\"This is an evil dream, Your Majesty,\" said Pallantides, suppressing a shudder. \"But no more.\"\n",
        "Conan shook his head, more in doubt than in denial. He came of a barbaric race, and the superstitions\n",
        "and instincts of his heritage lurked close beneath the surface of his consciousness.\n",
        "\"I've dreamed many evil dreams,\" he said, \"and most of them were meaningless. But by Crom, this was\n",
        "not like most dreams! I wish this battle were fought and won, for I've had a grisly premonition ever since\n",
        "King Nimed died in the black plague. Why did it cease when he died?\"\n",
        "\"Men say he sinned--\"\n",
        "\"Men are fools, as always,\" grunted Conan. \"If the plague struck all who sinned, then by Crom there\n",
        "wouldn't be enough left to count the living! Why should the gods--who the priests tell me are just--slay\n",
        "five hundred peasants and merchants and nobles before they slew the king, if the whole pestilence were \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "466\n",
        "aimed at him? Were the gods smiting blindly, like swordsmen in a fog? By Mitra, if I aimed my strokes\n",
        "no straighter, Aquilonia would have had a new king long ago.\n",
        "\"No! The black plague's no common pestilence. It lurks in Stygian tombs, and is called forth into being\n",
        "only by wizards. I was a swordsman in Prince Almuric's army that invaded Stygia, and of his thirty\n",
        "thousand, fifteen thousand perished by Stygian arrows, and the rest by the black plague that rolled on us\n",
        "like a wind out of the south. I was the only man who lived.\"\n",
        "\"Yet only five hundred died in Nemedia,\" argued Pallantides.\n",
        "\"Whoever called it into being knew how to cut it short at will,\" answered Conan. \"So I know there was\n",
        "something planned and diabolical about it. Someone called it forth, someone banished it when the work\n",
        "was completed--when Tarascus was safe on the throne and being hailed as the deliverer of the people\n",
        "from the wrath of the gods. By Crom, I sense a black, subtle brain behind all this. What of this stranger\n",
        "who men say gives counsel to Tarascus?\"\n",
        "\"He wears a veil,\" answered Pallantides; \"they say he is a foreigner; a stranger from Stygia.\"\n",
        "\"A stranger from Stygia!\" repeated Conan scowling. \"A stranger from Hell, more like!--Ha! What is that?\"\n",
        "\"The trumpets of the Nemedians!\" exclaimed Pallantides. \"And hark, how our own blare upon their heels!\n",
        "Dawn is breaking, and the captains are marshaling the hosts for the onset! Mitra be with them, for many\n",
        "will not see the sun go down behind the crags.\"\n",
        "\"Send my squires to me!\" exclaimed Conan, rising with alacrity and casting off his velvet night-garment;\n",
        "he seemed to have forgotten his forebodings at the prospect of action. \"Go to the captains and see that all\n",
        "is in readiness. I will be with you as soon as I don my armor.\"\n",
        "Many of Conan's ways were inexplicable to the civilized people he ruled, and one of them was his\n",
        "insistence on sleeping alone in his chamber or tent. Pallantides hastened from the pavilion, clanking in\n",
        "the armor he had donned at midnight after a few hours' sleep. He cast a swift glance over the camp,\n",
        "which was beginning to swarm with activity, mail clinking and men moving about dimly in the uncertain\n",
        "light, among the long lines of tents. Stars still glimmered palely in the western sky, but long pink\n",
        "streamers stretched along the eastern horizon, and against them the dragon banner of Nemedia flung out\n",
        "its billowing silken folds.\n",
        "Pallantides turned toward a smaller tent near by, where slept the royal squires. These were tumbling out\n",
        "already, roused by the trumpets. And as Pallantides called to them to hasten, he was frozen speechless by\n",
        "a deep fierce shout and the impact of a heavy blow inside the king's tent, followed by a heart-stopping\n",
        "crash of a falling body. There sounded a low laugh that turned the general's blood to ice.\n",
        "Echoing the cry, Pallantides wheeled and rushed back into the pavilion. He cried out again as he saw\n",
        "Conan's powerful frame stretched out on the carpet. The king's great two-handed sword lay near his\n",
        "hand, and a shattered tent-pole seemed to show where his sword had fallen. Pallantides' sword was out,\n",
        "and he glared about the tent, but nothing met his gaze. Save for the king and himself it was empty, as it\n",
        "had been when he left it.\n",
        "\"Your Majesty!\" Pallantides threw himself on his knees beside the fallen giant.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "467\n",
        "Conan's eyes were open; they blazed up at him with full intelligence and recognition. His lips writhed,\n",
        "but no sound came forth. He seemed unable to move.\n",
        "Voices sounded without. Pallantides rose swiftly and stepped to the door. The royal squires and one of\n",
        "the knights who guarded the tent stood there. \"We heard a sound within,\" said the knight apologetically.\n",
        "\"Is all well with the king?\"\n",
        "Pallantides regarded him searchingly.\n",
        "\"None has entered or left the pavilion this night?\"\n",
        "\"None save yourself, my lord,\" answered the knight, and Pallantides could not doubt his honesty.\n",
        "\"The king stumbled and dropped his sword,\" said Pallantides briefly. \"Return to your post.\"\n",
        "As the knight turned away, the general covertly motioned to the five royal squires, and when they had\n",
        "followed him in, he drew the flap closely. They turned pale at the sight of the king stretched upon the\n",
        "carpet, but Pallantides' quick gesture checked their exclamations.\n",
        "The general bent over him again, and again Conan made an effort to speak. The veins in his temples and\n",
        "the cords in his neck swelled with his efforts, and he lifted his head clear off the ground. Voice came at\n",
        "last, mumbling and half intelligible.\n",
        "\"The thing--the thing in the corner!\"\n",
        "Pallantides lifted his head and looked fearfully about him. He saw the pale faces of the squires in the\n",
        "lamplight, the velvet shadows that lurked along the walls of the pavilion. That was all.\n",
        "\"There is nothing here, Your Majesty,\" he said.\n",
        "\"It was there, in the corner,\" muttered the king, tossing his lion- maned head from side to side in his\n",
        "efforts to rise. \"A man--at least he looked like a man--wrapped in rags like a mummy's bandages, with a\n",
        "moldering cloak drawn about him, and a hood. All I could see was his eyes, as he crouched there in the\n",
        "shadows. I thought he was a shadow himself, until I saw his eyes. They were like black jewels.\n",
        "\"I made at him and swung my sword, but I missed him clean--how, Crom knows--and splintered that\n",
        "pole instead. He caught my wrist as I staggered off balance, and his fingers burned like hot iron. All the\n",
        "strength went out of me, and the floor rose and struck me like a club. Then he was gone, and I was down,\n",
        "and--curse him!--I can't move! I'm paralyzed!\"\n",
        "Pallantides lifted the giant's hand, and his flesh crawled. On the king's wrist showed the blue marks of\n",
        "long, lean fingers. What hand could grip so hard as to leave its print on that thick wrist? Pallantides\n",
        "remembered that low laugh he had heard as he rushed into the tent, and cold perspiration beaded his\n",
        "skin. It had not been Conan who laughed.\n",
        "\"This is a thing diabolical!\" whispered a trembling squire. \"Men say the children of darkness war for\n",
        "Tarascus!\"\n",
        "\"Be silent!\" ordered Pallantides sternly.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "468\n",
        "Outside, the dawn was dimming the stars. A light wind sprang up from the peaks, and brought the\n",
        "fanfare of a thousand trumpets. At the sound a convulsive shudder ran through the king's mighty form.\n",
        "Again the veins in his temples knotted as he strove to break the invisible shackles which crushed him\n",
        "down.\n",
        "\"Put my harness on me and tie me into my saddle,\" he whispered. \"I'll lead the charge yet!\"\n",
        "Pallantides shook his head, and a squire plucked his skirt.\n",
        "\"My lord, we are lost if the host learns the king has been smitten! Only he could have led us to victory this\n",
        "day.\"\n",
        "\"Help me lift him on the dais,\" answered the general.\n",
        "They obeyed, and laid the helpless giant on the furs, and spread a silken cloak over him. Pallantides\n",
        "turned to the five squires and searched their pale faces long before he spoke.\n",
        "\"Our lips must be sealed for ever as to what happens in this tent,\" he said at last. \"The kingdom of\n",
        "Aquilonia depends upon it. One of you go and fetch me the officer Valannus, who is a captain of the\n",
        "Pellian spearmen.\"\n",
        "The squire indicated bowed and hastened from the tent, and Pallantides stood staring down at the\n",
        "stricken king, while outside trumpets blared, drums thundered, and the roar of the multitudes rose in the\n",
        "growing dawn. Presently the squire returned with the officer Pallantides had named--a tall man, broad\n",
        "and powerful, built much like the king. Like him, also, he had thick black hair. But his eyes were gray and\n",
        "he did not resemble Conan in his features.\n",
        "\"The king is stricken by a strange malady,\" said Pallantides briefly. \"A great honor is yours; you are to\n",
        "wear his armor and ride at the head of the host today. None must know that it is not the king who rides.\"\n",
        "\"It is an honor for which a man might gladly give up his life,\" stammered the captain, overcome by the\n",
        "suggestion. \"Mitra grant that I do not fail of this mighty trust!\"\n",
        "And while the fallen king stared with burning eyes that reflected the bitter rage and humiliation that ate\n",
        "his heart, the squires stripped Valannus of mail shirt, burganet and leg-pieces, and clad him in Conan's\n",
        "armor of black plate mail, with the vizored salade, and the dark plumes nodding over the wivern crest.\n",
        "Over all they put the silken surcoat with the royal lion worked in gold upon the breast, and they girt him\n",
        "with a broad gold-buckled belt which supported a jewel- hilted broadsword in a cloth-of-gold scabbard.\n",
        "While they worked, trumpets clamored outside, arms clanged, and across the river rose a deep-throated\n",
        "roar as squadron after squadron swung into place.\n",
        "Full-armed, Vallanus dropped to his knee and bent his plumes before the figure that lay on the dais.\n",

        "\"Bring me Tarascus's head and I'll make you a baron!\" In the stress of his anguish Conan's veneer of\n",

        "The strongest part was the center, composed entirely of heavily armed knights; the wings were made up\n",

        "where they stood, smiting and thrusting, and over their mangled corpses beat the hoofs of the conquerors.\n",
        "But the squire had drawn the flap close, and in the confused madness of the slaughter none realized that\n",
        "the pavilion held an occupant. So the flight and the pursuit swept past, and roared away up the valley,\n",
        "and the squire looked out presently to see a cluster of men approaching the royal tent with evident\n",
        "purpose.\n",
        "\"Here comes the king of Nemedia with four companions and his squire,\" quoth he. \"He will accept your\n",
        "surrender, my fair lord--\"\n",
        "\"Surrender the devil's heart!\" gritted the king.\n",
        "He had forced himself up to a sitting posture. He swung his legs painfully off the dais, and staggered\n",
        "upright, reeling drunkenly. The squire ran to assist him, but Conan pushed him away.\n",
        "\"Give me that bow!\" he gritted, indicating a longbow and quiver that hung from a tent-pole.\n",
        "\"But Your Majesty!\" cried the squire in great perturbation. \"The battle is lost! It were the part of majesty to\n",
        "yield with the dignity becoming one of royal blood!\"\n",
        "\"I have no royal blood,\" ground Conan. \"I am a barbarian and the son of a blacksmith.\"\n",
        "Wrenching away the bow and an arrow, he staggered toward the opening of the pavilion. So formidable\n",
        "was his appearance, naked but for short leather breeks and sleeveless shirt, open to reveal his great, hairy\n",
        "chest, with his huge limbs and his blue eyes blazing under his tangled black mane, that the squire shrank\n",
        "back, more afraid of his king than of the whole Nemedian host.\n",
        "Reeling on wide-braced legs Conan drunkenly tore the door-flap open and staggered out under the\n",
        "canopy. The king of Nemedia and his companions had dismounted, and they halted short, staring in\n",
        "wonder at the apparition confronting them.\n",
        "\"Here I am, you jackals!\" roared the Cimmerian. \"I am the king! Death to you, dog-brothers!\"\n",
        "He jerked the arrow to its head and loosed, and the shaft feathered itself in the breast of the knight who\n",
        "stood beside Tarascus. Conan hurled the bow at the king of Nemedia.\n",
        "\"Curse my shaky hand! Come in and take me if you dare!\"\n",
        "Reeling backward on unsteady legs, he fell with his shoulders against a tent-pole, and propped upright,\n",
        "he lifted his great sword with both hands.\n",
        "\"By Mitra, it is the king!\" swore Tarascus. He cast a swift look about him, and laughed. \"That other was a\n",
        "jackal in his harness! In, dogs, and take his head!\"\n",
        "The three soldiers--men-at-arms wearing the emblem of the royal guards-- rushed at the king, and one\n",
        "felled the squire with a blow of a mace. The other two fared less well. As the first rushed in, lifting his\n",
        "sword, Conan met him with a sweeping stroke that severed mail-links like cloth, and sheared the \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "473\n",
        "Nemedian's arm and shoulder clean from his body. His corpse, pitching backward, fell across his\n",
        "companion's legs. The man stumbled, and before he could recover, the great sword was through him.\n",
        "Conan wrenched out his steel with a racking gasp, and staggered back against the tent-pole. His great\n",
        "limbs trembled, his chest heaved, and sweat poured down his face and neck. But his eyes flamed with\n",
        "exultant savagery and he panted: \"Why do you stand afar off, dog of Belverus? I can't reach you; come in\n",
        "and die!\" Tarascus hesitated, glanced at the remaining man-at-arms, and his squire, a gaunt, saturnine\n",
        "man in black mail, and took a step forward. He was far inferior in size and strength to the giant\n",
        "Cimmerian, but he was in full armor, and was famed in all the western nations as a swordsman. But his\n",
        "squire caught his arm.\n",
        "\"Nay, Your Majesty, do not throw away your life. I will summon archers to shoot this barbarian, as we\n",
        "shoot lions.\"\n",
        "Neither of them had noticed that a chariot had approached while the fight was going on, and now came\n",
        "to a halt before them. But Conan saw, looking over their shoulders, and a queer chill sensation crawled\n",
        "along his spine. There was something vaguely unnatural about the appearance of the black horses that\n",
        "drew the vehicle, but it was the occupant of the chariot that arrested the king's attention.\n",
        "He was a tall man, superbly built, clad in a long unadorned silk robe. He wore a Shemitish head-dress,\n",
        "and its lower folds hid his features, except for the dark, magnetic eyes. The hands that grasped the reins,\n",
        "pulling the rearing horses back on their haunches, were white but strong. Conan glared at the stranger,\n",
        "all his primitive instincts roused. He sensed an aura of menace and power that exuded from this veiled\n",
        "figure, a menace as definite as the windless waving of tall grass that marks the path of the serpent.\n",
        "\"Hail, Xaltotun!\" exclaimed Tarascus. \"Here is the king of Aquilonia! He did not die in the landslide as we\n",
        "thought.\"\n",
        "\"I know,\" answered the other, without bothering to say how he knew. \"What is your present intention?\"\n",
        "\"I will summon the archers to slay him,\" answered the Nemedian. \"As long as he lives he will be\n",
        "dangerous to us.\"\n",
        "\"Yet even a dog has uses,\" answered Xaltotun. \"Take him alive.\"\n",
        "Conan laughed raspingly. \"Come in and try!\" he challenged. \"But for my treacherous legs I'd hew you out\n",
        "of that chariot like a woodman hewing a tree. But you'll never take me alive, damn you!\"\n",
        "\"He speaks the truth, I fear,\" said Tarascus. \"The man is a barbarian, with the senseless ferocity of a\n",
        "wounded tiger. Let me summon the archers.\"\n",
        "\"Watch me and learn wisdom,\" advised Xaltotun.\n",
        "His hand dipped into his robe and came out with something shining--a glistening sphere. This he threw\n",
        "suddenly at Conan. The Cimmerian contemptuously struck it aside with his sword--at the instant of\n",
        "contact there was a sharp explosion, a flare of white, blinding flame, and Conan pitched senseless to the\n",
        "ground.\n",
        "\"He is dead?\" Tarascus' tone was more assertion than inquiry.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "474\n",
        "\"No. He is but senseless. He will recover his senses in a few hours. Bid your men bind his arms and legs\n",
        "and lift him into my chariot.\"\n",
        "With a gesture Tarascus did so, and they heaved the senseless king into the chariot, grunting with their\n",
        "burden. Xaltotun threw a velvet cloak over his body, completely covering him from any who might peer\n",
        "in. He gathered the reins in his hands.\n",
        "\"I'm for Belverus,\" he said. \"Tell Amalric that I will be with him if he needs me. But with Conan out of the\n",
        "way, and his army broken, lance and sword should suffice for the rest of the conquest. Prospero cannot\n",
        "be bringing more than ten thousand men to the field, and will doubtless fall back to Tarantia when he\n",
        "hears the news of the battle. Say nothing to Amalric or Valerius or anyone about our capture. Let them\n",
        "think Conan died in the fall of the cliffs.\"\n",
        "He looked at the man-at-arms for a long space, until the guardsman moved restlessly, nervous under the\n",
        "scrutiny.\n",
        "\"What is that about your waist?\" Xaltotun demanded.\n",
        "\"Why, my girdle, may it please you, my lord!\" stuttered the amazed guardsman.\n",
        "\"You lie!\" Xaltotun's laugh was merciless as a sword edge. \"It is a poisonous serpent! What a fool you are,\n",
        "to wear a reptile about your waist!\"\n",
        "With distended eyes the man looked down; and to his utter horror he saw the buckle of his girdle rear up\n",
        "at him. It was a snake's head! He saw the evil eyes and the dripping fangs, heard the hiss and felt the\n",
        "loathsome contact of the thing about his body. He screamed hideously and struck at it with his naked\n",
        "hand, felt its fangs flesh themselves in that hand--and then he stiffened and fell heavily. Tarascus looked\n",
        "down at him without expression. He saw only the leathern girdle and the buckle, the pointed tongue of\n",
        "which was stuck in the guardsman's palm. Xaltotun turned his hypnotic gaze on Tarascus' squire, and the\n",
        "man turned ashen and began to tremble, but the king interposed: \"Nay, we can trust him.\"\n",
        "The sorcerer tautened the reins and swung the horses around. \"See that this piece of work remains secret.\n",
        "If I am needed, let Altaro, Orastes' servant, summon me as I have taught him. I will be in your palace at\n",
        "Belverus.\"\n",
        "Tarascus lifted his hand in salutation, but his expression was not pleasant to see as he looked after the\n",
        "departing mesmerist.\n",
        "\"Why should he spare the Cimmerian?\" whispered the frightened squire.\n",
        "\"That I am wondering myself,\" grunted Tarascus. Behind the rumbling chariot the dull roar of battle and\n",

        "OF THAT LONG ride in the chariot of Xaltotun, Conan knew nothing. He lay like a dead man while the\n",

        "valleys, and finally dropping down from the rugged heights, rumbled rhythmically along the broad\n",
        "white road that winds through the rich meadowlands to the walls of Belverus.\n",
        "Just before dawn some faint reviving of life touched him. He heard a mumble of voices, the groan of\n",
        "ponderous hinges. Through a slit in the cloak that covered him he saw, faintly in the lurid glare of torches,\n",
        "the great black arch of a gateway, and the bearded faces of men-at- arms, the torches striking fire from\n",
        "their spearheads and helmets.\n",

        "A babble of excited voices rose, drowned the next instant by the whirling wheels of the chariot on the\n",

        "Conan heard one of the guardsmen mutter: \"From beyond the border to Belverus between sunset and\n",
        "dawn! And the horses scarcely sweating! By Mitra, they--\" Then silence drank the voices, and there was\n",
        "only the clatter of hoofs and wheels along the shadowy street.\n",
        "What he had heard registered itself on Conan's brain but suggested nothing to him. He was like a\n",
        "mindless automaton that hears and sees, but does not understand. Sights and sounds flowed\n",
        "meaninglessly about him. He lapsed again into a deep lethargy, and was only dimly aware when the\n",
        "chariot halted in a deep, high-walled court, and he was lifted from it by many hands and borne up a\n",
        "winding stone stair, and down a long dim corridor. Whispers, stealthy footsteps, unrelated sounds\n",
        "surged or rustled about him, irrelevant and far away.\n",
        "Yet his ultimate awakening was abrupt and crystal-clear. He possessed full knowledge of the battle in the\n",
        "mountains and its sequences, and he had a good idea of where he was.\n",
        "He lay on a velvet couch, clad as he was the day before, but with his limbs loaded with chains not even\n",
        "he could break. The room in which he lay was furnished with somber magnificence, the walls covered\n",
        "with black velvet tapestries, the floor with heavy purple carpets. There was no sign of door or window,\n",
        "and one curiously carven gold lamp, swinging from the fretted ceiling, shed a lurid light over all.\n",
        "In that light the figure seated in a silver, thronelike chair before him seemed unreal and fantastic, with an\n",
        "illusiveness of outline that was heightened by a filmy silken robe. But the features were distinct--\n",
        "unnaturally so in that uncertain light. It was almost as if a weird nimbus played about the man's head,\n",
        "casting the bearded face into bold relief, so that it was the only definite and distinct reality in that mystic,\n",
        "ghostly chamber.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "476\n",
        "It was a magnificent face, with strongly chiseled features of classical beauty. There was, indeed,\n",
        "something disquieting about the calm tranquility of its aspect, a suggestion of more than human\n",
        "knowledge, of a profound certitude beyond human assurance. Also an uneasy sensation of familiarity\n",
        "twitched at the back of Oman's consciousness. He had never seen this man's face before, he well knew;\n",
        "yet those features reminded him of something or someone. It was like encountering in the flesh some\n",
        "dream-image that had haunted one in nightmares.\n",
        "\"Who are you?\" demanded the king belligerently, struggling to a sitting position in spite of his chains.\n",
        "\"Men call me Xaltotun,\" was the reply, in a strong, golden voice.\n",
        "\"What place is this?\" the Cimmerian next demanded.\n",
        "\"A chamber in the palace of King Tarascus, in Belverus.\"\n",
        "Conan was not surprized. Belverus, the capital, was at the same time the largest Nemedian city so near\n",

        "\"And where's Tarascus?\"\n",
        "\"With the army.\"\n",
        "\"Well,\" growled Conan, \"if you mean to murder me, why don't you do it and get it over with?\"\n",
        "\"I did not save you from the king's archers to murder you in Belverus,\" answered Xaltotun.\n",
        "\"What the devil did you do to me?\" demanded Conan.\n",
        "\"I blasted your consciousness,\" answered Xaltotun. \"How, you would not understand. Call it black magic,\n",
        "if you will.\"\n",
        "Conan had already reached that conclusion, and was mulling over something else.\n",
        "\"I think I understand why you spared my life,\" he rumbled. \"Amalric wants to keep me as a check on\n",
        "Valerius, in case the impossible happens and he becomes king of Aquilonia. It's well known that the\n",

        "it's beyond your power to buy and sell the throne of Aquilonia at your will. The kingdom's not conquered;\n",
        "one battle doesn't decide a war.\"\n",
        "\"You war against more than swords,\" answered Xaltotun. \"Was it a mortal's sword that felled you in your\n",
        "tent before the fight? Nay, it was a child of the dark, a waif of outer space, whose fingers were afire with\n",
        "the frozen coldness of the black gulfs, which froze the blood in your veins and the marrow of your thews.\n",
        "Coldness so cold it burned your flesh like white-hot iron!\"\n",

        "Conan glared at him unspeaking, feeling a chill along his spine. Wizards and sorcerers abounded in his\n",
        "barbaric mythology, and any fool could tell that this was no common man. Conan sensed an inexplicable\n",
        "something about him that set him apart--an alien aura of Time and Space, a sense of tremendous and\n",
        "sinister antiquity. But his stubborn spirit refused to flinch.\n",
        "\"The fall of the cliffs was chance,\" he muttered truculently. \"The charge into the defile was what any man\n",
        "would have done.\"\n",
        "\"Not so. You would not have led a charge into it. You would have suspected a trap. You would never\n",
        "have crossed the river in the first place, until you were sure the Nemedian rout was real. Hypnotic\n",
        "suggestions would not have invaded your mind, even in the madness of battle, to make you mad, and\n",
        "rush blindly into the trap laid for you, as it did the lesser man who masqueraded as you.\"\n",
        "\"Then if this was all planned,\" Conan grunted skeptically, \"all a plot to trap my host, why did not the\n",

        "\"Because I wished to take you alive. It took no wizardry to predict that Pallantides would send another\n",

        "which he seemed to have forgotten, fell suddenly to the floor, as if its invisible support had been removed.\n",
        "Then the blacks had lifted Conan--for so loaded with chains was he that he could not walk--and carried\n",
        "him from the chamber. A glance back, before the heavy, gold-bound teak door was closed, showed him\n",
        "Xaltotun leaning back in his thronelike chair, his arms folded, while a thin wisp of smoke curled up from\n",
        "the brazier. Oman's scalp prickled. In Stygia, that ancient and evil kingdom that lay far to the south, he\n",
        "had seen such black dust before. It was the pollen of the black lotus, which creates deathlike sleep and\n",
        "monstrous dreams; and he knew that only the grisly wizards of the Black Ring, which is the nadir of evil,\n",
        "voluntarily seek the scarlet nightmares of the black lotus, to revive their necromantic powers.\n",
        "The Black Ring was a fable and a lie to most folk of the western world, but Conan knew of its ghastly\n",
        "reality, and its grim votaries who practise their abominable sorceries amid the black vaults of Stygia and\n",
        "the nighted domes of accursed Sabatea. He glanced back at the cryptic, gold-bound door, shuddering at\n",
        "what it hid.\n",
        "Whether it was day or night the king could not tell. The palace of King Tarascus seemed a shadowy,\n",
        "nighted place, that shunned natural illumination. The spirit of darkness and shadow hovered over it, and\n",
        "that spirit, Conan felt, was embodied in the stranger Xaltotun. The negroes carried the king along a\n",
        "winding corridor so dimly lighted that they moved through it like black ghosts bearing a dead man, and\n",
        "down a stone stair that wound endlessly. A torch in the hand of one cast the great deformed shadows\n",
        "streaming along the wall; it was like the descent into hell of a corpse borne by dusky demons.\n",
        "At last they reached the foot of the stair, and then they traversed a long straight corridor, with a blank\n",
        "wall on one hand pierced by an occasional arched doorway with a stair leading up behind it, and on the\n",
        "other hand another wall showing heavy barred doors at regular intervals of a few feet.\n",
        "Halting before one of these doors, one of the blacks produced the key that hung at his girdle, and turned\n",
        "it in the lock. Then, pushing open the grille, they entered with their captive. They were in a small\n",
        "dungeon with heavy stone walls, floor and ceiling, and in the opposite wall there was another grilled\n",
        "door. What lay beyond that door Conan could not tell, but he did not believe it was another corridor. The\n",
        "glimmering light of the torch, flickering through the bars, hinted at shadowy spaciousness and echoing\n",
        "depths.\n",
        "In one corner of the dungeon, near the door through which they had entered, a cluster of rusty chains\n",
        "hung from a great iron ring set in the stone. In these chains a skeleton dangled. Conan glared at it with\n",
        "some curiosity, noticing the state of the bare bones, most of which were splintered and broken; the skull\n",
        "which had fallen from the vertebrae, was crushed as if by some savage blow of tremendous force.\n",
        "Stolidly one of the blacks, not the one who had opened the door, removed the chains from the ring, using\n",
        "his key on the massive lock, and dragged the mass of rusty metal and shattered bones over to one side. \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "480\n",
        "Then they fastened Conan's chains to that ring, and the third black turned his key in the lock of the\n",
        "farther door, grunting when he had assured himself that it was properly fastened.\n",
        "Then they regarded Conan cryptically, slit-eyed ebony giants, the torch striking highlights from their\n",
        "glossy skin.\n",
        "He who held the key to the nearer door was moved to remark, gutturally: \"This your palace now, white\n",
        "dog-king! None but master and we know. All palace sleep. We keep secret. You live and die here, maybe.\n",
        "Like him!\" He contemptuously kicked the shattered skull and sent it clattering across the stone floor.\n",
        "Conan did not deign to reply to the taunt and the black, galled perhaps by his prisoner's silence, muttered\n",
        "a curse, stooped and spat full in the king's face. It was an unfortunate move for the black. Conan was\n",
        "seated on the floor, the chains about his waist; ankles and wrists locked to the ring in the wall. He could\n",
        "neither rise, nor move more than a yard out from the wall. But there was considerable slack in the chains\n",
        "that shackled his wrists, and before the bullet-shaped head could be withdrawn out of reach, the king\n",
        "gathered this slack in his mighty hand and smote the black on the head. The man fell like a butchered ox\n",
        "and his comrades stared to see him lying with his scalp laid open, and blood oozing from his nose and\n",
        "ears.\n",
        "But they attempted no reprisal, nor did they accept Conan's urgent invitation to approach within reach of\n",
        "the bloody chain in his hand. Presently, grunting in their apelike speech, they lifted the senseless black\n",
        "and bore him out like a sack of wheat, arms and legs dangling. They used his key to lock the door behind\n",
        "them, but did not remove it from the gold chain that fastened it to his girdle. They took the torch with\n",
        "them, and as they moved up the corridor the darkness slunk behind them like an animate thing. Their\n",

        "wilderness-bred ancestors, not to betray his position in his helplessness. This did not result from a logical\n",

        "palace; yet for some reason a shaft had been constructed from somewhere above. Outside, the moon had\n",
        "risen to a point where its light slanted dimly down the shaft. He reflected that in this manner he could tell\n",
        "the passing of the days and nights. Perhaps the sun, too, would shine down that shaft, though on the\n",

        "futile speculation as to who the wretch had been and for what reason he had been doomed, but he\n",
        "wondered at the shattered condition of the bones. They had not been broken on a rack. Then, as he\n",
        "looked, another unsavory detail made itself evident. The shin-bones were split lengthwise, and there was\n",
        "but one explanation; they had been broken in that manner in order to obtain the marrow. Yet what\n",
        "creature but man breaks bones for their marrow? Perhaps those remnants were mute evidence of a\n",
        "horrible, cannibalistic feast, of some wretch driven to madness by starvation. Conan wondered if his own\n",

        "The Cimmerian did not curse, scream, weep or rave as a civilized man might have done. But the pain and\n",

        "Somewhere, far to the westward, the Nemedian host was slashing and burning its way through the heart\n",
        "of his kingdom. The small host of Poitanians could not stand before them. Prospero might be able to hold\n",

        "Surely the barons would rally to him against the invaders. But in the meanwhile he, Conan, must lie\n",
        "helpless in a darkened cell, while others led his spears and fought for his kingdom. The king ground his\n",
        "powerful teeth in red rage.\n",
        "Then he stiffened as outside the farther door he heard a stealthy step. Straining his eyes he made out a\n",
        "bent, indistinct figure outside the grille. There was a rasp of metal against metal, and he heard the clink of\n",
        "tumblers, as if a key had been turned in the lock. Then the figure moved silently out of his range of vision.\n",
        "Some guard, he supposed, trying the lock. After a while he heard the sound repeated faintly somewhere\n",
        "farther on, and that was followed by the soft opening of a door, and then a swift scurry of softly shod feet\n",
        "retreated in the distance. Then silence fell again.\n",
        "Conan listened for what seemed a long time, but which could not have been, for the moon still shone\n",
        "down the hidden shaft, but he heard no further sound. He shifted his position at last, and his chains\n",
        "clanked. Then he heard another, lighter footfall--a soft step outside the nearer door, the door though\n",
        "which he had entered the cell. An instant later a slender figure was etched dimly in the gray light.\n",
        "\"King Conan!\" a soft voice intoned urgently. \"Oh, my lord, are you there?\"\n",
        "\"Where else?\" he answered guardedly, twisting his head about to stare at the apparition.\n",
        "It was a girl who stood grasping the bars with her slender fingers. The dim glow behind her outlined her\n",
        "supple figure through the wisp of silk twisted about her loins, and shone vaguely on jeweled breastplates. Her dark eyes gleamed in the shadows, her white limbs glistened softly, like alabaster. Her hair\n",
        "was a mass of dark foam, at the burnished luster of which the dim light only hinted.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "482\n",
        "\"The keys to your shackles and to the farther door!\" she whispered, and a slim white hand came through\n",
        "the bars and dropped three objects with a clink to the flags beside him.\n",
        "\"What game is this?\" he demanded. \"You speak in the Nemedian tongue, and I have no friends in\n",
        "Nemedia. What deviltry is your master up to now? Has he sent you here to mock me?\"\n",
        "\"It is no mockery!\" The girl was trembling violently. Her bracelets and breast-plates clinked against the\n",
        "bars she grasped. \"I swear by Mitra! I stole the keys from the black jailers. They are the keepers of the pits,\n",
        "and each bears a key which will open only one set of locks. I made them drunk. The one whose head you\n",
        "broke was carried away to a leech, and I could not get his key. But the others I stole. Oh, please do not\n",
        "loiter! Beyond these dungeons lie the pits which are the doors to Hell.\"\n",
        "Somewhat impressed, Conan tried the keys dubiously, expecting to meet only failure and a burst of\n",
        "mocking laughter. But he was galvanized to discover that one, indeed, loosed him of his shackles, fitting\n",
        "not only the lock that held them to the ring, but the locks on his limbs as well. A few seconds later he\n",
        "stood upright, exulting fiercely in his comparative freedom. A quick stride carried him to the grille, and\n",
        "his fingers closed about a bar and the slender wrist that was pressed against it, imprisoning the owner,\n",
        "who lifted her face bravely to his fierce gaze.\n",
        "\"Who are you, girl?\" he demanded. \"Why do you do this?\"\n",
        "\"I am only Zenobia,\" she murmured, with a catch of breathlessness, as if in fright; \"only a girl of the king's\n",
        "seraglio.\"\n",
        "\"Unless this is some cursed trick,\" muttered Conan, \"I cannot see why you bring me these keys.\"\n",
        "She bowed her dark head, and then lifted it and looked full into his suspicious eyes. Tears sparkled like\n",
        "jewels on her long dark lashes.\n",
        "\"I am only a girl of the king's seraglio,\" she said, with a certain humility. \"He has never glanced at me,\n",
        "and probably never will. I am less than one of the dogs that gnaw the bones in his banquet hall.\n",
        "\"But I am no painted toy; I am of flesh and blood. I breathe, hate, fear, rejoice and love. And I have loved\n",
        "you. King Conan, ever since I saw you riding at the head of your knights along the streets of Belverus\n",
        "when you visited King Nimed, years ago. My heart tugged at its strings to leap from my bosom and fall\n",
        "in the dust of the street under your horse's hoofs.\"\n",
        "Color flooded her countenance as she spoke, but her dark eyes did not waver. Conan did not at once\n",
        "reply; wild and passionate and untamed he was, yet any but the most brutish of men must be touched\n",
        "with a certain awe or wonder at the baring of a woman's naked soul.\n",
        "She bent her head then, and pressed her red lips to the fingers that imprisoned her slim wrist. Then she\n",
        "flung up her head as if in sudden recollection of their position, and terror flared in her dark eyes. \"Haste!\"\n",
        "she whispered urgently. \"It is past midnight. You must be gone.\"\n",
        "\"But won't they skin you alive for stealing these keys?\"\n",
        "\"They'll never know. If the black men remember in the morning who gave them the wine, they will not\n",
        "dare admit the keys were stolen from them while they were drunk. The key that I could not obtain is the \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "483\n",
        "one that unlocks this door. You must make your way to freedom through the pits. What awful perils lurk\n",
        "beyond that door I cannot even guess. But greater danger lurks for you if you remain in this cell.\n",
        "\"King Tarascus has returned--\"\n",
        "\"What? Tarascus?\"\n",
        "\"Aye! He has returned, in great secrecy, and not long ago he descended into the pits and then came out\n",
        "again, pale and shaking, like a man who had dared a great hazard. I heard him whisper to his squire,\n",
        "Arideus, that despite Xaltotun you should die.\"\n",
        "\"What of Xaltotun?\" murmured Conan. He felt her shudder.\n",
        "\"Do not speak of him!\" she whispered. \"Demons are often summoned by the sound of their names. The\n",
        "slaves say that he lies in his chamber, behind a bolted door, dreaming the dreams of the black lotus. I\n",
        "believe that even Tarascus secretly fears him, or he would slay you openly. But he has been in the pits\n",
        "tonight, and what he did here, only Mitra knows.\"\n",
        "\"I wonder if that could have been Tarascus who fumbled at my cell door awhile ago?\" muttered Conan.\n",
        "\"Here is a dagger!\" she whispered, pressing something through the bars. His eager fingers closed on an\n",
        "object familiar to their touch. \"Go quickly through yonder door, turn to the left and make your way along\n",
        "the cells until you come to a stone stair. On your life do not stray from the line of the cells! Climb the stair\n",
        "and open the door at the top; one of the keys will fit it. If it be the will of Mitra, I will await you there.\"\n",
        "Then she was gone, with a patter of light slippered feet.\n",
        "Conan shrugged his shoulders, and turned toward the farther grille. This might be some diabolical trap\n",
        "planned by Tarascus, but plunging headlong into a snare was less abhorrent to Conan's temperament\n",
        "than sitting meekly to await his doom. He inspected the weapon the girl had given him, and smiled\n",
        "grimly. Whatever else she might be, she was proven by that dagger to be a person of practical intelligence.\n",
        "It was no slender stiletto, selected because of a jeweled hilt or gold guard, fitted only for dainty murder in\n",
        "milady's boudoir; it was a forthright poniard, a warrior's weapon, broad-bladed, fifteen inches in length,\n",
        "tapering to a diamond-sharp point.\n",
        "He grunted with satisfaction. The feel of the hilt cheered him and gave him a glow of confidence.\n",
        "Whatever webs of conspiracy were drawn about him, whatever trickery and treachery ensnared him, this\n",
        "knife was real. The great muscles of his right arm swelled in anticipation of murderous blows.\n",
        "He tried the farther door, fumbling with the keys as he did so. It was not locked. Yet he remembered the\n",
        "black man locking it. That furtive, bent figure, then, had been no jailer seeing that the bolts were in place.\n",
        "He had unlocked the door, instead. There was a sinister suggestion about that unlocked door. But Conan\n",
        "did not hesitate. He pushed open the grille and stepped from the dungeon into the outer darkness.\n",
        "As he had thought, the door did not open into another corridor. The flagged floor stretched away under\n",
        "his feet, and the line of cells ran away to right and left behind him, but he could not make out the other\n",
        "limits of the place into which he had come. He could see neither the roof nor any other wall. The\n",
        "moonlight filtered into that vastness only through the grilles of the cells, and was almost lost in the \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "484\n",
        "darkness. Less keen eyes than his could scarcely have discerned the dim gray patches that floated before\n",
        "each cell door.\n",
        "Turning to the left, he moved swiftly and noiselessly along the line of dungeons, his bare feet making no\n",
        "sound on the flags. He glanced briefly into each dungeon as he passed it. They were all empty, but locked.\n",
        "In some he caught the glimmer of naked white bones. These pits were a relic of a grimmer age,\n",
        "constructed long ago when Belverus was a fortress rather than a city. But evidently their more recent use\n",
        "had been more extensive than the world guessed.\n",
        "Ahead of him, presently, he saw the dim outline of a stair sloping sharply upward, and knew it must be\n",
        "the stair he sought. Then he whirled suddenly, crouching in the deep shadows at its foot.\n",
        "Somewhere behind him something was moving--something bulky and stealthy that padded on feet\n",
        "which were not human feet. He was looking down the long row of cells, before each one of which lay a\n",
        "square of dim gray light that was little more than a patch of less dense darkness. But he saw something\n",
        "moving along these squares. What it was he could not tell, but it was heavy and huge, and yet it moved\n",
        "with more than human ease and swiftness. He glimpsed it as it moved across the squares of gray, then\n",
        "lost it as it merged in the expanses of shadow between. It was uncanny, in its stealthy advance, appearing\n",
        "and disappearing like a blur of the vision.\n",
        "He heard the bars rattle as it tried each door in turn. Now it had reached the cell he had so recently\n",
        "quitted, and the door swung open as it tugged. He saw a great bulky shape limned faintly and briefly in\n",
        "the gray doorway, and then the thing had vanished into the dungeon. Sweat beaded Conan's face and\n",
        "hands. Now he knew why Tarascus had come so subtly to his door, and later had fled so swiftly. The\n",
        "king had unlocked his door, and, somewhere in these hellish pits, had opened a cell or cage that held\n",
        "some grim monstrosity.\n",
        "Now the thing was emerging from the cell and was again advancing up the corridor, its misshapen head\n",
        "close to the ground. It paid no more heed to the locked doors. It was smelling out his trail. He saw it more\n",
        "plainly now; the gray light limned a giant anthropomorphic body, but vaster of bulk and girth than any\n",
        "man. It went on two legs, though it stooped forward, and it was grayish and shaggy, its thick coat shot\n",
        "with silver. Its head was a grisly travesty of the human, its long arms hung nearly to the ground.\n",
        "Conan knew it at last--understood the meaning of those crushed and broken bones in the dungeon, and\n",
        "recognized the haunter of the pits. It was a gray ape, one of the grisly man-eaters from the forests that\n",
        "wave on the mountainous eastern shores of the Sea of Vilayet. Half mythical and altogether horrible,\n",
        "these apes were the goblins of Hyborian legendry, and were in reality ogres of the natural world,\n",
        "cannibals and murderers of the nighted forests.\n",
        "He knew it scented his presence, for it was coming swiftly now, rolling its barrel-like body rapidly along\n",
        "on its short, mighty, bowed legs. He cast a quick glance up the long stair, but knew that the thing would\n",
        "be on his back before he could mount to the distant door. He chose to meet it face to face.\n",
        "Conan stepped out into the nearest square of moonlight, so as to have all the advantage of illumination\n",
        "that he could; for the beast, he knew, could see better than himself in the dark. Instantly the brute saw\n",
        "him; its great yellow tusks gleamed in the shadows, but it made no sound. Creatures of night and the \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "485\n",
        "silence, the gray apes of Vilayet were voiceless. But in its dim, hideous features, which were a bestial\n",
        "travesty of a human face, showed ghastly exultation.\n",
        "Conan stood poised, watching the oncoming monster without a quiver. He knew he must stake his life on\n",
        "one thrust; there would be no chance for another; nor would there be time to strike and spring away. The\n",
        "first blow must kill, and kill instantly, if he hoped to survive that awful grapple. He swept his gaze over\n",
        "the short, squat throat, the hairy swagbelly, and the mighty breast, swelling in giant arches like twin\n",
        "shields. It must be the heart; better to risk the blade being deflected by the heavy ribs than to strike in\n",
        "where a stroke was not instantly fatal. With full realization of the odds, Conan matched his speed of eye\n",
        "and hand and his muscular power against the brute might and ferocity of the man-eater. He must meet\n",
        "the brute breast to breast, strike a deathblow, and then trust to the ruggedness of his frame to survive the\n",
        "instant of manhandling that was certain to be his.\n",
        "As the ape came rolling in on him, swinging wide its terrible arms, he plunged in between them and\n",
        "struck with all his desperate power. He felt the blade sink to the hilt in the hairy breast, and instantly,\n",
        "releasing it, he ducked his head and bunched his whole body into one compact mass of knotted muscles,\n",
        "and as he did so he grasped the closing arms and drove his knee fiercely into the monster's belly, bracing\n",

        "more. This touch-and-go sort of battling was too strenuous even for the giant Cimmerian. The moonlight\n",

        "Conan listened intently, but he heard no sound throughout the palace. He did not know in what part of\n",
        "the palace he was, or in which direction lay the chamber of Xaltotun. The girl was trembling as she drew\n",

        "by the tapestries, that ran to an ornately carved door, barely visible in the dim light that filtered in from\n",
        "the outer corridor. And as he stared into it, somewhere beyond that carven door he heard the sound of\n",
        "another door opening and shutting, and then a low mumble of voices. The familiar sound of one of those\n",
        "voices caused a sinister expression to cross his dark face. Without hesitation he glided down the passage,\n",
        "and crouched like a stalking panther beside the door. It was not locked, and manipulating it delicately, he\n",
        "pushed it open a crack, with a reckless disregard for possible consequences that only he could have\n",

        "chamber lit by a candle on an ebony table. There were two men in that chamber. One was a scarred,\n",
        "sinister-looking ruffian in leather breeks and ragged cloak; the other was Tarascus, king of Nemedia.\n",
        "Tarascus seemed ill at ease. He was slightly pale, and he kept starting and glancing about him, as if\n",
        "expecting and fearing to hear some sound or footstep.\n",
        "\"Go swiftly and at once,\" he was saying. \"He is deep in drugged slumber, but I know not when he may\n",
        "awaken.\"\n",
        "\"Strange to hear words of fear issuing from the lips of Tarascus,\" rumbled the other in a harsh, deep voice.\n",
        "The king frowned.\n",
        "\"I fear no common man, as you well know. But when I saw the cliffs fall at Valkia I knew that this devil\n",
        "we had resurrected was no charlatan. I fear his powers, because I do not know the full extent of them. But\n",
        "I know that somehow they are connected with this accursed thing which I have stolen from him. It\n",
        "brought him back to life; so it must be the source of his sorcery.\n",
        "\"He had it hidden well; but following my secret order a slave spied on him and saw him place it in a\n",

        "himself not been sunk in lotus slumber.\n",
        "\"I believe it is the secret of his power. With it Orastes brought him back to life. With it he will make us all\n",

        "far from land that neither tide nor storm can wash it up on the beach. You have been paid.\"\n",
        "\"So I have,\" grunted the ruffian. \"And I owe more than gold to you, king; I owe you a debt of gratitude.\n",

        "\"Whatever debt you may feel you owe me,\" answered Tarascus, \"will be paid when you have hurled this\n",

        "\"I'll ride for Zingara and take ship from Kordava,\" promised the other. \"I dare not show my head in Argos,\n",

        "\"I care not, so it is done. Here it is; a horse awaits you in the court. Go, and go swiftly!\"\n",
        "Something passed between them, something that flamed like living fire. Conan had only a brief glimpse\n",
        "of it; and then the ruffian pulled a slouch hat over his eyes, drew his cloak about his shoulder, and\n",
        "hurried from the chamber. And as the door closed behind him, Conan moved with the devastating fury\n",
        "of unchained blood-lust. He had held himself in check as long as he could. The sight of his enemy so near\n",
        "him set his wild blood seething and swept away all caution and restraint.\n",
        "Tarascus was turning toward an inner door when Conan tore aside the hangings and leaped like a bloodmad panther into the room. Tarascus wheeled, but even before he could recognize his attacker, Conan's\n",
        "poniard ripped into him.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "489\n",
        "But the blow was not mortal, as Conan knew the instant he struck. His foot had caught in a fold of the\n",

        "along his ribs, and the king of Nemedia screamed.\n",
        "The impact of the blow and Conan's lunging body hurled him back against the table and it toppled and\n",
        "the candle went out. They were both carried to the floor by the violence of Conan's rush, and the foot of\n",
        "the tapestry hampered them both in its folds. Conan was stabbing blindly in the dark, Tarascus\n",
        "screaming in a frenzy of panicky terror. As if fear lent him superhuman energy, Tarascus tore free and\n",

        "The yells of Tarascus were still resounding in the distance, and a wild outcry was bursting forth in\n",
        "answer. The Nemedian had escaped him in the darkness, and Conan did not know which way he had\n",
        "gone. The Cimmerian's rash stroke for vengeance had failed, and there remained only the task of saving\n",
        "his own hide if he could.\n",
        "Swearing luridly, Conan ran back down the passage and into the alcove, glaring out into the lighted\n",

        "\"Oh, what has happened?\" she cried. \"The palace is roused! I swear I have not betrayed you--\"\n",
        "\"No, it was I who stirred up the hornet's nest,\" he grunted. \"I tried to pay off a score. What's the shortest\n",
        "way out of this?\"\n",
        "She caught his wrist and ran fleetly down the corridor. But before they reached the heavy door at the\n",

        "other side. Zenobia wrung her hands and whimpered.\n",

        "to the postern gate lies through it.\"\n",
        "Conan wheeled. Up the corridor, though still out of sight, he heard a rising clamor that told him his foes\n",
        "were behind as well as before him--\n",
        "\"Quick! Into this door!\" the girl cried desperately, running across the corridor and throwing open the\n",
        "door of a chamber.\n",
        "Conan followed her through, and then threw the gold catch behind them. They stood in an ornately\n",
        "furnished chamber, empty but for themselves, and she drew him to a gold-barred window, through\n",
        "which he saw trees and shrubbery.\n",
        "\"You are strong,\" she panted. \"If you can tear these bars away, you may yet escape. The garden is full of\n",
        "guards, but the shrubs are thick, and you may avoid them. The southern wall is also the outer wall of the\n",
        "city. Once over that, you have a chance to get away. A horse is hidden for you in a thicket beside the road\n",
        "that runs westward, a few hundred paces to the south of the fountain of Thrallos. You know where it is?\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "490\n",
        "\"Aye! But what of you? I had meant to take you with me.\"\n",
        "A flood of joy lighted her beautiful face.\n",
        "\"Then my cup of happiness is brimming! But I will not hamper your escape. Burdened with me you\n",
        "would fail. Nay, do not fear for me. They will never suspect that I aided you willingly. Go! What you\n",
        "have just said will glorify my life throughout the long years.\"\n",
        "He caught her up in his iron arms, crushed her slim, vibrant figure to him and kissed her fiercely on eyes,\n",
        "cheeks, throat and lips, until she lay panting in his embrace; gusty and tempestuous as a storm-wind,\n",
        "even his lovemaking was violent.\n",
        "\"I'll go,\" he muttered. \"But by Crom, I'll come for you some day!\"\n",
        "Wheeling, he gripped the gold bars and tore them from their sockets with one tremendous wrench; threw\n",
        "a leg over the sill and went down swiftly, clinging to the ornaments on the wall. He hit the ground\n",
        "running and melted like a shadow into the maze of towering rosebushes and spreading trees. The one\n",
        "look he cast back over his shoulder showed him Zenobia leaning over the windowsill, her arms stretched\n",
        "after him in mute farewell and renunciation.\n",
        "Guards were running through the garden, all converging toward the palace, where the clamor\n",
        "momentarily grew louder--tall men in burnished cuirasses and crested helmets of polished bronze. The\n",
        "starlight struck glints from their gleaming armor, among the trees, betraying their every movement; but\n",
        "the sound of their coming ran far before them. To Conan, wilderness-bred, their rush through the\n",
        "shrubbery was like the blundering stampede of cattle. Some of them passed within a few feet of where he\n",
        "lay flat in a thick cluster of bushes, and never guessed his presence. With the palace as their goal, they\n",
        "were oblivious to all else about them. When they had gone shouting on, he rose and fled through the\n",
        "garden with no more noise than a panther would have made.\n",
        "So quickly he came to the southern wall, and mounted the steps that led to the parapet. The wall was\n",
        "made to keep people out, not in. No sentry patrolling the battlements was in sight. Crouching by an\n",
        "embrasure he glanced back at the great palace rearing above the cypresses behind him. Lights blazed\n",
        "from every window, and he could see figures flitting back and forth across them like puppets on invisible\n",
        "strings. He grinned hardly, shook his fist in a gesture of farewell and menace, and let himself over the\n",
        "outer rim of the parapet.\n",
        "A low tree, a few yards below the parapet, received Conan's weight, as he dropped noiselessly into the\n",
        "branches. An instant later he was racing through the shadows with the swinging hillman's stride that eats\n",
        "up long miles.\n",
        "Gardens and pleasure villas surrounded the walls of Belverus. Drowsy slaves, sleeping by their\n",
        "watchman's pikes, did not see the swift and furtive figure that scaled walls, crossed alleys made by the\n",
        "arching branches of trees, and threaded a noiseless way through orchards and vineyards. Watchdogs\n",
        "woke and lifted their deep-booming clamor at a gliding shadow, half scented, half sensed, and then it\n",
        "was gone.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "491\n",
        "In a chamber of the palace, Tarascus writhed and cursed on a blood- spattered couch, under the deft,\n",
        "quick fingers of Orastes. The palace was thronged with wide-eyed, trembling servitors, but the chamber\n",
        "where the king lay was empty save for himself and the renegade priest.\n",
        "\"Are you sure he still sleeps?\" Tarascus demanded again, setting his teeth against the bite of the herb\n",
        "juices with which Orastes was bandaging the long, ragged gash in his shoulder and ribs. \"Ishtar, Mitra\n",
        "and Set! That burns like molten pitch of hell!\"\n",
        "\"Which you would be experiencing even now, but for your good fortune,\" remarked Orastes. \"Whoever\n",
        "wielded that knife struck to kill. Yes, I have told you that Xaltotun still sleeps. Why are you so urgent\n",
        "upon that point? What has he to do with this?\"\n",
        "\"You know nothing of what has passed in the palace tonight?\" Tarascus searched the priest's countenance\n",
        "with burning intensity.\n",
        "\"Nothing. As you know, I have been employed in translating manuscripts for Xaltotun, for some months\n",
        "now, transcribing esoteric volumes written in the younger languages into script he can read. He was well\n",
        "versed in all the tongues and scripts of his day, but he has not yet learned all the newer languages, and to\n",
        "save time he has me translate these works for him, to learn if any new knowledge has been discovered\n",
        "since his time. I did not know that he had returned last night until he sent for me and told me of the battle.\n",
        "Then I returned to my studies, nor did I know that you had returned until the clamor in the palace\n",
        "brought me out of my cell.\"\n",
        "\"Then you do not know that Xaltotun brought the king of Aquilonia a captive to this palace?\"\n",
        "Orastes shook his head, without particular surprize. \"Xaltotun merely said that Conan would oppose us\n",
        "no more. I supposed that he had fallen, but did not ask the details.\"\n",
        "\"Xaltotun saved his life when I would have slain him,\" snarled Tarascus. \"I saw his purpose instantly. He\n",
        "would hold Conan captive to use as a club against us--against Amalric, against Valerius, and against\n",
        "myself. So long as Conan lives he is a threat, a unifying factor for Aquilonia, that might be used to compel\n",
        "us into courses we would not otherwise follow. I mistrust this undead Pythonian. Of late I have begun to\n",
        "fear him.\n",
        "\"I followed him, some hours after he had departed eastward. I wished to learn what he intended doing\n",
        "with Conan. I found that he had imprisoned him in the pits. I intended to see that the barbarian died, in\n",
        "spite of Xaltotun. And I accomplished--\" A cautious knock sounded at the door. \"That's Arideus,\" grunted\n",
        "Tarascus. \"Let him in.\" The saturnine squire entered, his eyes blazing with suppressed excitement. \"How,\n",
        "Arideus?\" exclaimed Tarascus. \"Have you found the man who attacked me?\"\n",
        "\"You did not see him, my lord?\" asked Arideus, as one who would assure himself of a fact he already\n",
        "knows to exist. \"You did not recognize him?\"\n",
        "\"No. It happened so quick, and the candle was out--all I could think of was that it was some devil loosed\n",
        "on me by Xaltotun's magic--\"\n",
        "\"The Pythonian sleeps in his barred and bolted room. But I have been in the pits.\" Arideus twitched his\n",
        "lean shoulders excitedly.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "492\n",
        "\"Well, speak, man!\" exclaimed Tarascus impatiently. \"What did you find there?\"\n",
        "\"An empty dungeon,\" whispered the squire. \"The corpse of the great ape!\"\n",
        "\"What?\" Tarascus started upright, and blood gushed from his opened wound.\n",
        "\"Aye! The man-eater is dead--stabbed through the heart--and Conan is gone!\"\n",
        "Tarascus was gray of face as he mechanically allowed Orastes to force him prostrate again and the priest\n",
        "renewed work upon his mangled flesh.\n",
        "\"Conan!\" he repeated. \"Not a crushed corpse--escaped! Mitra! He is no man; but a devil himself! I thought\n",
        "Xaltotun was behind this wound. I see now. Gods and devils! It was Conan who stabbed me! Arideus!\"\n",
        "\"Aye, Your Majesty!\"\n",
        "\"Search every nook in the palace. He may be skulking through the dark corridors now like a hungry tiger.\n",
        "Let no niche escape your scrutiny, and beware. It is not a civilized man you hunt, but a blood-mad\n",
        "barbarian whose strength and ferocity are those of a wild beast. Scour the palace-grounds and the city.\n",
        "Throw a cordon about the walls. If you find he has escaped from the city, as he may well do, take a troop\n",

        "and you may yet catch him.\"\n",

        "\"No!\" exclaimed Tarascus violently. \"Let the troopers pursue Conan and slay him. Xaltotun can hold no\n",

        "presenting a moving target so that thrusts and swings cut empty air oftener than not. Yet when he struck\n",

        "Conan, scrambling up, saw the man lying dead with his throat torn out, and a great gray wolf stood over\n",
        "him, head sunk as it smelt the blood that formed a pool on the grass.\n",

        "deep thickets and along tortuous ledges poised over deep ravines she led him, and finally along a narrow\n",
        "precipice-edged path to a curious dwelling of stone, half hut, half cavern, beneath a cliff hidden among\n",
        "the gorges and crags. The eagle flew to the pinnacle of this cliff, and perched there like a motionless\n",
        "sentinel.\n",
        "Still silent, Zeiata stabled the horse in a near-by cave, with leaves and grass piled high for provender, and\n",
        "a tiny spring bubbling in the dim recesses.\n",
        "In the hut she seated the king on a rude, hide-covered bench, and she herself sat upon a low stool before\n",

        "drowsed beside her, facing the fire, his huge head sunk on his paws, his ears twitching in his dreams.\n",
        "\"You do not fear to sit in the hut of a witch?\" she asked, breaking her silence at last.\n",
        "An impatient shrug of his gray-mailed shoulders was her guest's only reply. She gave into his hands a\n",
        "wooden dish heaped with dried fruits, cheese and barley bread, and a great pot of the heady upland beer,\n",
        "brewed from barley grown in the high valleys.\n",

        "the smoke and flame of a pillaged land. In the great square of Tarantia the frantic throng milled and\n",
        "yammered, screaming that the king was dead, that the barons were girding themselves to divide the land\n",
        "between them, and that the rule of a king, even of Valerius, was better than anarchy. Prospero, shining in\n",
        "his armor, rode among them, trying to pacify them, bidding them trust Count Trocero, urging them to\n",
        "man the wall and aid his knights in defending the city. They turned on him, shrieking with fear and\n",
        "unreasoning rage, howling that he was Trocero's butcher, a more evil foe than Amalric himself. Offal and\n",

        "\"You have seen--the people of your capital have forfeited the freedom you won for them by sweat and\n",
        "blood; they have sold themselves to the slavers and the butchers. They have shown that they do not trust\n",
        "their destiny. Can you rely upon them for the winning back of your kingdom?\"\n",
        "\"They thought I was dead,\" he grunted, recovering some of his poise. \"I have no son. Men can't be\n",
        "governed by a memory. What if the Nemedians have taken Tarantia? There still remain the provinces, the\n",
        "barons, and the people of the countrysides. Valerius has won an empty glory.\"\n",
        "\"You are stubborn, as befits a fighter. I cannot show you the future, I cannot show you all the past. Nay, I\n",
        "show you nothing. I merely make you see windows opened in the veil by powers un-guessed. Would you\n",
        "look into the past for a clue of the present?\"\n",
        "\"Aye.\" He seated himself abruptly.\n",
        "Again the green smoke rose and billowed. Again images unfolded before him, this time alien and\n",
        "seemingly irrelevant. He saw great towering black walls, pedestals half hidden in the shadows upholding\n",
        "images of hideous, half-bestial gods. Men moved in the shadows, dark, wiry men, clad in red, silken\n",
        "loincloths. They were bearing a green jade sarcophagus along a gigantic black corridor. But before he\n",
        "could tell much about what he saw, the scene shifted. He saw a cavern, dim, shadowy and haunted with\n",
        "a strange intangible horror. On an altar of black stone stood a curious golden vessel, shaped like the shell\n",
        "of a scallop. Into this cavern came some of the same dark, wiry men who had borne the mummy-case.\n",
        "They seized the golden vessel, and then the shadows swirled around them and what happened he could\n",
        "not say. But he saw a glimmer in a whorl of darkness, like a ball of living fire. Then the smoke was only\n",
        "smoke, drifting up from the fire of tamarisk chunks, thinning and fading.\n",
        "\"But what does this portend?\" he demanded, bewildered. \"What I saw in Tarantia I can understand. But\n",
        "what means this glimpse of Zamorian thieves sneaking through a subterranean temple of Set, in Stygia?\n",
        "And that cavern-I've never seen or heard of anything like it, in all my wanderings. If you can show me\n",
        "that much, these shreds of vision which mean nothing, disjointed, why can you not show me all that is to\n",
        "occur?\"\n",
        "Zeiata stirred the fire without replying.\n",
        "\"These things are governed by immutable laws,\" she said at last. \"I can not make you understand; I do not\n",
        "altogether understand myself, though I have sought wisdom in the silences of the high places for more\n",
        "years than I can remember. I cannot save you, though I would if I might. Man must, at last, work out his \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "500\n",
        "own salvation. Yet perhaps wisdom may come to me in dreams, and in the morn I may be able to give\n",
        "you the clue to the enigma.\"\n",
        "\"What enigma?\" he demanded.\n",
        "\"The mystery that confronts you, whereby you have lost a kingdom,\" she answered. And then she spread\n",
        "a sheepskin upon the floor before the hearth. \"Sleep,\" she said briefly. Without a word he stretched\n",
        "himself upon it, and sank into restless but deep sleep through which phantoms moved silently and\n",
        "monstrous shapeless shadows crept. Once, limned against a purple sunless horizon, he saw the mighty\n",
        "walls and towers of a great city of such as rose nowhere on the waking earth he knew. Its colossal pylons\n",
        "and purple minarets lifted toward the stars, and over it, floating like a giant mirage, hovered the bearded\n",
        "countenance of the man Xaltotun.\n",
        "Conan woke in the chill whiteness of early dawn, to see Zelata crouched beside the tiny fire. He had not\n",
        "awakened once in the night, and the sound of the great wolf leaving or entering should have roused him.\n",
        "Yet the wolf was there, beside the hearth, with its shaggy coat wet with dew, and with more than dew.\n",
        "Blood glistened wetly amid the thick fell, and there was a cut upon his shoulder.\n",
        "Zeiata nodded, without looking around, as if reading the thoughts of her royal guest.\n",
        "\"He has hunted before dawn, and red was the hunting. I think the man who hunted a king will hunt no\n",
        "more, neither man nor beast.\"\n",
        "Conan stared at the great beast with strange fascination as he moved to take the food Zelata offered him.\n",
        "\"When I come to my throne again I won't forget,\" he said briefly. \"You've befriended me--by Crom, I can't\n",
        "remember when I've lain down and slept at the mercy of man or woman as I did last night. But what of\n",
        "the riddle you would read me this morn?\"\n",
        "A long silence ensued, in which the crackle of the tamarisks was loud on the hearth.\n",
        "\"Find the heart of your kingdom,\" she said at last. \"There lies your defeat and your power. You fight more\n",
        "than mortal man. You will not possess the throne again unless you find the heart of your kingdom.\"\n",
        "\"Do you mean the city of Tarantia?\"\n",
        "She shook her head. \"I am but an oracle, through whose lips the gods speak. My lips are sealed by them\n",
        "lest I speak too much. You must find the heart of your kingdom. I can say no more. My lips are opened\n",
        "and sealed by the gods.\"\n",
        "Dawn was still white on the peaks when Conan rode westward. A glance back showed him Zelata\n",
        "standing in the door of her hut, inscrutable as ever, the great wolf beside her.\n",
        "A gray sky arched overhead, and a moaning wind was chill with a promise of winter. Brown leaves\n",
        "fluttered slowly down from the bare branches, sifting upon his mailed shoulders.\n",
        "All day he pushed through the hills, avoiding roads and villages. Toward nightfall he began to drop\n",
        "down from the heights, tier by tier, and saw the broad plains of Aquilonia spread out beneath him.\n",

        "Villages and farms lay close to the foot of the hills on the western side of the mountains for, for half a\n",
        "century, most of the raiding across the frontier had been done by the Aquilonians. But now only embers\n",
        "and ashes showed where farm huts and villas had stood.\n",
        "In the gathering darkness Conan rode slowly on. There was little fear of discovery, which he dreaded\n",
        "from friend as well as from foe. The Nemedians had remembered old scores on their westward drive, and\n",
        "Valerius had made no attempt to restrain his allies. He did not count on winning the love of the common\n",
        "people. A vast swath of desolation had been cut through the country from the foothills westward. Conan\n",
        "cursed as he rode over blackened expanses that had been rich fields, and saw the gaunt gable ends of\n",
        "burned houses jutting against the sky. He moved through an empty and deserted land, like a ghost out of\n",
        "a forgotten and outworn past.\n",
        "The speed with which the army had traversed the land showed what little resistance it had encountered.\n",
        "Yet had Conan been leading his Aquilonians the invading army would have been forced to buy every\n",
        "foot they gained with their blood. The bitter realization permeated his soul; he was not the representative\n",
        "of a dynasty. He was only a lone adventurer. Even the drop of dynastic blood Valerius boasted had more\n",
        "hold on the minds of men than the memory of Conan and the freedom and power he had given the\n",
        "kingdom.\n",
        "No pursuers followed him down out of the hills. He watched for wandering or returning Nemedian\n",
        "troops, but met none. Skulkers gave him a wide path, supposing him to be one of the conquerors, what of\n",
        "his harness. Groves and rivers were far more plentiful on the western side of the mountains, and coverts\n",
        "for concealment were not lacking.\n",
        "So he moved across the pillaged land, halting only to rest his horse, eating frugally of the food Zeiata had\n",
        "given him, until, on a dawn when he lay hidden on a river bank where willows and oaks grew thickly, he\n",
        "glimpsed, afar, across the rolling plains dotted with rich groves, the blue and golden towers of Tarantia.\n",
        "He was no longer in a deserted land, but one teeming with varied life. His progress thenceforth was slow\n",
        "and cautious, through thick woods and unfrequented byways. It was dusk when he reached the\n",

        "Dismounting and tying his horse, he approached the thick, arched door with the intention of sending the\n",

        "him.\n",
        "\"Who are you?\" he demanded. \"What is your--Mitra!\"\n",
        "His breath hissed inward and his ruddy face paled. \"Avaunt!\" he ejaculated. \"Why have you come back\n",
        "from the gray lands of death to terrify me? I was always your true liegeman in your lifetime--\"\n",
        "\"As I still expect you to be,\" answered Conan. \"Stop trembling, man; I'm flesh and blood.\"\n",
        "Sweating with uncertainty Servius approached and stared into the face of the mail-clad giant, and then,\n",
        "convinced of the reality of what he saw, he dropped to one knee and doffed his plumed cap.\n",
        "\"Your Majesty! Truly, this is a miracle passing belief! The great bell in the citadel has tolled your dirge,\n",
        "days agone. Men said you died at Valkia, crushed under a million tons of earth and broken granite.\"\n",
        "\"It was another in my harness,\" grunted Conan. \"But let us talk later. If there is such a thing as a joint of\n",
        "beef on your board--\"\n",
        "\"Forgive me, my lord!\" cried Servius, springing to his feet. \"The dust of travel is gray on your mail, and I\n",
        "keep you standing here without rest or sup! Mitra! I see well enough now that you are alive, but I swear,\n",
        "when I turned and saw you standing all gray and dim in the twilight, the marrow of my knees turned to\n",

        "\"Bid the keeper see to my steed which is tied behind yonder oak,\" requested Conan, and Servius nodded,\n",
        "drawing the king up the path. The patrician, recovering from his supernatural fright, had become\n",

        "\"I will send a servant from the manor,\" he said. \"The keeper is in his lodge--but I dare not trust even my\n",

        "Approaching the great house that glimmered dimly through the trees, he turned aside into a little-used\n",
        "path that ran between close-set oaks whose intertwining branches formed a vault overhead, shutting out\n",
        "the dim light of the gathering dusk. Servius hurried on through the darkness without speaking, and with\n",
        "something resembling panic in his manner, and presently led Conan through a small side door into a\n",
        "narrow, dimly illuminated corridor. They traversed this in haste and silence, and Servius brought the\n",
        "king into a spacious chamber with a high, oak-beamed ceiling and richly paneled walls. Logs flamed in\n",
        "the wide fireplace, for there was a frosty edge to the air, and a great meat pasty in a stone platter stood \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "503\n",
        "smoking on a broad mahogany board. Servius locked the massive door and extinguished the candles that\n",

        "\"Your pardon, Your Majesty,\" he apologized. \"These are perilous times; spies lurk everywhere. It were\n",
        "better that none be able to peer through the windows and recognize you. This pasty, however, is just\n",

        "deign--\"\n",
        "\"The light is sufficient,\" grunted Conan, seating himself with scant ceremony, and drawing his poniard.\n",
        "He dug ravenously into the luscious dish, and washed it down with great gulps of wine from grapes\n",
        "grown in Servius's vineyards. He seemed oblivious to any sense of peril, but Servius shifted uneasily on\n",
        "his settle by the fire, nervously fingering the heavy gold chain about his neck. He glanced continually at\n",
        "the diamond panes of the casement, gleaming dimly in the firelight, and cocked his ear toward the door,\n",
        "as if half expecting to hear the pad of furtive feet in the corridor without.\n",
        "Finishing his meal, Conan rose and seated himself on another settle before the fire.\n",

        "your plantation.\"\n",
        "\"My lord--\" Servius lifted his hands in expostulation, but Conan waved his protests aside.\n",
        "\"I know your loyalty and your courage. Both are above reproach. But if Valerius has usurped my throne,\n",
        "it would be death for you to shelter me, if you were discovered.\"\n",
        "\"I am not strong enough to defy him openly,\" admitted Servius. \"The fifty men-at-arms I could lead to\n",
        "battle would be but a handful of straws. You saw the ruins of Emilius Scavonus' plantation?\"\n",
        "Conan nodded, frowning darkly.\n",
        "\"He was the strongest patrician in this province, as you know. He refused to give his allegiance to\n",
        "Valerius. The Nemedians burned him in the ruins of his own villa. After that the rest of us saw the futility\n",
        "of resistance, especially as the people of Tarantia refused to fight. We submitted and Valerius spared our\n",
        "lives, though he levied a tax upon us that will ruin many. But what could we do? We thought you were\n",
        "dead. Many of the barons had been slain, others taken prisoner. The army was shattered and scattered.\n",
        "You have no heir to take the crown. There was no one to lead us--\"\n",
        "\"Was there not Count Trocero of Poitain?\" demanded Conan harshly.\n",
        "Servius spread his hands helplessly.\n",
        "\"It is true that his general Prospero was in the field with a small army. Retreating before Amalric, he\n",
        "urged men to rally to his banner. But with Your Majesty dead, men remembered old wars and civil\n",
        "brawls, and how Trocero and his Poitanians once rode through these provinces even as Amalric was\n",
        "riding now, with torch and sword. The barons were jealous of Trocero. Some men--spies of Valerius\n",
        "perhaps--shouted that the Count of Poitain intended seizing the crown for himself. Old sectional hates\n",
        "flared up again. If we had had one man with dynastic blood in his veins, we would have crowned and\n",
        "followed him against Nemedia. But we had none.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "504\n",
        "\"The barons who followed you loyally would not follow one of their own number, each holding himself\n",
        "as good as his neighbor, each fearing the ambitions of the others. You were the cord that held the fagots\n",
        "together. When the cord was cut, the fagots fell apart. If you had had a son, the barons would have rallied\n",
        "loyally to him. But there was no point for their patriotism to focus upon.\n",
        "\"The merchants and commoners, dreading anarchy and a return of feudal days when each baron was his\n",
        "own law, cried out that any king was better than none, even Valerius, who was at least of the blood of the\n",
        "old dynasty. There was no one to oppose him when he rode up at the head of his steel-clad hosts, with\n",
        "the scarlet dragon of Nemedia floating over him, and rang his lance against the gates of Tarantia.\n",
        "\"Nay, the people threw open the gates and knelt in the dust before him. They had refused to aid Prospero\n",
        "in holding the city. They said they had rather be ruled by Valerius than by Trocero. They said--\n",
        "truthfully--that the barons would not rally to Trocero, but that many would accept Valerius. They said\n",

        "\"Aye, in the coronation hall, with the blood of slaughter scarcely dried on his hands.\"\n",
        "\"And do the people thrive under his benevolent rule?\" asked Conan with angry irony.\n",
        "\"He lives like a foreign prince in the midst of a conquered land,\" answered Servius bitterly. \"His court is\n",
        "filled with Nemedians, the palace troops are of the same breed, and a large garrison of them occupy the\n",
        "citadel. Aye, the hour of the Dragon has come at last.\n",
        "\"Nemedians swagger like lords through the streets. Women are outraged and merchants plundered daily,\n",
        "and Valerius either can, or will, make no attempt to curb them. Nay, he is but their puppet, their\n",
        "figurehead. Men of sense knew he would be, and the people are beginning to find it out.\n",
        "\"Amalric has ridden forth with a strong army to reduce the outlying provinces where some of the barons\n",
        "have defied him. But there is no unity among them. Their jealousy of each other is stronger than their fear\n",
        "of Amalric. He will crush them one by one. Many castles and cities, realizing that, have sent in their\n",
        "submission. Those who resist fare miserably. The Nemedians are glutting their long hatred. And their\n",
        "ranks are swelled by Aquilonians whom fear, gold, or necessity of occupation are forcing into their\n",

        "Conan nodded somberly, staring at the red reflections of the firelight on the richly carved oaken panels.\n",
        "\"Aquilonia has a king instead of the anarchy they feared,\" said Servius at last. \"Valerius does not protect\n",

        "sold to the Kothic slave-traders.\"\n",
        "Conan's head jerked up and a lethal flame lit his blue eyes. He swore gustily, his mighty hands knotting\n",

        "\"Gunderland in the north and Poitain in the south are yet unconquered, and there are unsubdued\n",

        "your memory. I myself saw it. Armed men dropped like flies and died in the streets in a manner no man\n",
        "could understand. And the lean priest laughed and said: 'I am only Altaro, only an acolyte of Orastes,\n",

        "me.'\"\n",
        "\"Well,\" said Conan harshly, \"is it not better to die honorably than to live in infamy? Is death worse than\n",

        "\"When the fear of sorcery is in, reason is out,\" replied Servius. \"The fear of the central provinces is too\n",
        "great to allow them to rise for you. The outlying provinces would fight for you--but the same sorcery that\n",
        "smote your army at Valkia would smite you again. The Nemedians hold the broadest, richest and most\n",
        "thickly populated sections of Aquilonia, and they cannot be defeated by the forces which might still be at\n",

        "King Conan, you are a king without a kingdom.\"\n",
        "Conan stared into the fire without replying. A smoldering log crashed down among the flames without a\n",
        "bursting shower of sparks. It might have been the crashing ruin of his kingdom.\n",
        "Again Conan felt the presence of a grim reality behind the veil of material illusion. He sensed again the\n",
        "inexorable drive of a ruthless fate. A feeling of furious panic tugged at his soul, a sense of being trapped,\n",
        "and a red rage that burned to destroy and kill.\n",

        "Conan started and stared at Servius with such anger smoldering in his blue eyes that the patrician shrank\n",
        "back.\n",
        "\"Why?\"\n",
        "\"Because she would not become the mistress of Valerius. Her lands are forfeit, her henchmen sold into\n",

        "you into exile.\"\n",
        "Conan shook his head. Servius glanced uneasily at him as he sat staring into the fire, his chin propped on\n",
        "his mighty fist. The firelight gleamed redly on his steel mail, on his baleful eyes. They burned in the\n",
        "firelight like the eyes of a wolf. Servius was again aware, as in the past, and now more strongly than ever,\n",
        "of something alien about the king. That great frame under the mail mesh was too hard and supple for a\n",
        "civilized man; the elemental fire of the primitive burned in those smoldering eyes. Now the barbaric\n",
        "suggestion about the king was more pronounced, as if in his extremity the outward aspects of civilization\n",
        "were stripped away, to reveal the primordial core. Conan was reverting to his pristine type. He did not\n",
        "act as a civilized man would act under the same conditions, nor did his thoughts run in the same\n",

        "\"What do you mean, your Majesty?\" asked Servius, shaken by a premonition.\n",
        "\"I'm going into Tarantia after Albiona tonight,\" answered the king. \"I've failed all my other loyal subjects,\n",

        "closing about it.\n",
        "\"There are secrets to the Tower which few know,\" said Conan. \"Anyway, I'd be a dog to leave Albiona to\n",
        "die because of her loyalty to me. I may be a king without a kingdom, but I'm not a man without honor.\"\n",
        "\"It will ruin us all!\" whispered Servius.\n",
        "\"It will ruin no one but me if I fail. You've risked enough. I ride alone tonight. This is all I want you to do:\n",

        "Upon these well-lighted thoroughfares the usual throngs went about their business, and shops and stalls\n",

        "the brown jerkin of a free workman regarding him fixedly. This man turned away with undue haste, and\n",
        "vanished in the shifting throng. But Conan turned into a narrow bystreet and quickened his pace. It\n",

        "The grim Iron Tower stood apart from the citadel, amid a maze of narrow streets and crowding houses\n",
        "where the meaner structures, appropriating a space from which the more fastidious shrank, had invaded\n",
        "a portion of the city ordinarily alien to them. The Tower was in reality a castle, an ancient, formidable pile\n",

        "Not a long distance from it, lost in a tangle of partly deserted tenements and warehouses, stood an\n",
        "ancient watchtower, so old and forgotten that it did not appear on the maps of the city for a hundred\n",
        "years back. Its original purpose had been forgotten, and nobody, of such as saw it at all, noticed that the\n",
        "apparently ancient lock which kept it from being appropriated as sleeping-quarters by beggars and\n",
        "thieves, was in reality comparatively new and extremely powerful, cunningly disguised into an\n",

        "No keyhole showed in the massive, green-crusted lock. But Conan's practised fingers, stealing over it,\n",
        "pressed here and there knobs invisible to the casual eye. The door silently opened inward and he entered\n",

        "cylindrical shaft of massive stone.\n",
        "Groping in a corner with the sureness of familiarity, he found the projections for which he was feeling on\n",
        "a slab of the stone that composed the floor. Quickly he lifted it, and without hesitation lowered himself\n",
        "into the aperture beneath. His feet felt stone steps leading downward into what he knew was a narrow\n",
        "tunnel that ran straight toward the foundations of the Iron Tower, three streets away.\n",
        "The bell on the citadel, which tolled only at the midnight hour or for the death of a king, boomed\n",
        "suddenly. In a dimly lighted chamber in the Iron Tower a door opened and a form emerged into a\n",

        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "509\n",
        "were rough, unadorned. The flags of the floor were worn deep by generations of faltering feet, and the\n",
        "vault of the ceiling was gloomy in the dim light of torches set in niches.\n",
        "The man who trudged down that grim corridor was in appearance in keeping with his surroundings. He\n",
        "was a tall, powerfully-built man, clad in close-fitting black silk. Over his head was drawn a black hood\n",
        "which fell about his shoulders, having two holes for his eyes. From his shoulders hung a loose black cloak,\n",
        "and over one shoulder he bore a heavy ax, the shape of which was that of neither tool nor weapon.\n",
        "As he went down the corridor, a figure came hobbling up it, a bent, surly old man, stooping under the\n",
        "weight of his pike and a lantern he bore in one hand.\n",
        "\"You are not as prompt as your predecessor, master headsman,\" he grumbled. \"Midnight has just struck,\n",
        "and masked men have gone to milady's cell. They await you.\"\n",
        "\"The tones of the bell still echo among the towers,\" answered the executioner. \"If I am not so quick to leap\n",
        "and run at the beck of Aquilonians as was the dog who held this office before me, they shall find my arm\n",
        "no less ready. Get you to your duties, old watchman, and leave me to mine. I think mine is the sweeter\n",
        "trade, by Mitra, for you tramp cold corridors and peer at rusty dungeon doors, while I lop off the fairest\n",
        "head in Tarantia this night.\"\n",
        "The watchman limped on down the corridor, still grumbling, and the headsman resumed his leisurely\n",
        "way. A few strides carried him around a turn in the corridor, and he absently noted that at his left a door\n",
        "stood partly open. If he had thought, he would have known that that door had been opened since the\n",
        "watchman passed; but thinking was not his trade. He was passing the unlocked door before he realized\n",
        "that aught was amiss, and then it was too late.\n",
        "A soft tigerish step and the rustle of a cloak warned him, but before he could turn, a heavy arm hooked\n",
        "about his throat from behind, crushing the cry before it could reach his lips. In the brief instant that was\n",
        "allowed him he realized with a surge of panic the strength of his attacker, against which his own brawny\n",
        "thews were helpless. He sensed without seeing the poised dagger.\n",
        "\"Nemedian dog!\" muttered a voice thick with passion in his ear. \"You've cut off your last Aquilonian\n",
        "head!\"\n",
        "And that was the last thing he ever heard.\n",
        "In a dank dungeon, lighted only by a guttering torch, three men stood about a young woman who knelt\n",
        "on the rush-strewn flags staring wildly up at them. She was clad only in a scanty shift; her golden hair fell\n",
        "in lustrous ripples about her white shoulders, and her wrists were bound behind her. Even in the\n",
        "uncertain torchlight, and in spite of her disheveled condition and pallor of fear, her beauty was striking.\n",
        "She knelt mutely, staring with wide eyes up at her tormentors. The men were closely masked and cloaked.\n",
        "Such a deed as this needed masks, even in a conquered land. She knew them all nevertheless; but what\n",
        "she knew would harm no one--after that night.\n",
        "\"Our merciful sovereign offers you one more chance, Countess,\" said the tallest of the three, and he spoke\n",
        "Aquilonian without an accent. \"He bids me say that if you soften your proud, rebellious spirit, he will still\n",
        "open his arms to you. If not--\" he gestured toward a grim wooden block in the center of the cell. It was \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "510\n",
        "blackly stained, and showed many deep nicks as if a keen edge, cutting through some yielding substance,\n",
        "had sunk into the wood.\n",
        "Albiona shuddered and turned pale, shrinking back. Every fiber in her vigorous young body quivered\n",
        "with the urge of life. Valerius was young, too, and handsome. Many women loved him, she told herself,\n",
        "fighting with herself for life. But she could not speak the word that would ransom her soft young body\n",
        "from the block and the dripping ax. She could not reason the matter. She only knew that when she\n",
        "thought of the clasp of Valerius' arms, her flesh crawled with an abhorrence greater than the fear of death.\n",
        "She shook her head helplessly, compelled by an impulsion more irresistible than the instinct to live.\n",
        "\"Then there is no more to be said!\" exclaimed one of the others impatiently, and he spoke with a\n",
        "Nemedian accent. \"Where is the headsman?\"\n",
        "As if summoned by the word, the dungeon door opened silently, and a great figure stood framed in it,\n",
        "like a black shadow from the underworld.\n",
        "Albiona voiced a low, involuntary cry at the sight of that grim shape, and the others stared silently for a\n",
        "moment, perhaps themselves daunted with superstitious awe at the silent, hooded figure. Through the\n",
        "coif the eyes blazed like coals of blue fire, and as these eyes rested on each man in turn, he felt a curious\n",
        "chill travel down his spine.\n",
        "Then the tall Aquilonian roughly seized the girl and dragged her to the block. She screamed\n",
        "uncontrollably and fought hopelessly against him, frantic with terror, but he ruthlessly forced her to her\n",
        "knees, and bent her yellow head down to the bloody block.\n",
        "\"Why do you delay, headsman?\" he exclaimed angrily. \"Perform your task!\"\n",
        "He was answered by a short, gusty boom of laughter that was indescribably menacing. All in the\n",
        "dungeon froze in their places, staring at the hooded shape--the two cloaked figures, the masked man\n",
        "bending over the girl, the girl herself on her knees, twisting her imprisoned head to look upward.\n",
        "\"What means this unseemly mirth, dog?\" demanded the Aquilonian uneasily.\n",
        "The man in the black garb tore his hood from his head and flung it to the ground; he set his back to the\n",
        "closed door and lifted the headsman's ax.\n",
        "\"Do you know me, dogs?\" he rumbled. \"Do you know me?\"\n",
        "The breathless silence was broken by a scream.\n",
        "\"The king!\" shrieked Albiona, wrenching herself free from the slackened grasp of her captor. \"Oh, Mitra,\n",
        "the king!\"\n",
        "The three men stood like statues, and then the Aquilonian started and spoke, like a man who doubts his\n",
        "own senses.\n",
        "\"Conan!\" he ejaculated. \"It is the king, or his ghost! What devil's work is this?\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "511\n",
        "\"Devil's work to match devils!\" mocked Conan, his lips laughing but Hell flaming in his eyes. \"Come, fall\n",
        "to, my gentlemen. You have your swords, and I this cleaver. Nay, I think this butcher's tool fits the work\n",
        "at hand, my fair lords!\"\n",
        "\"At him!\" muttered the Aquilonian, drawing his sword. \"It is Conan and we must kill or be killed!\"\n",
        "And like men waking from a trance, the Nemedians drew their blades and rushed on the king.\n",
        "The headsman's ax was not made for such work, but the king wielded the heavy, clumsy weapon as\n",
        "lightly as a hatchet, and his quickness of foot, as he constantly shifted his position, defeated their purpose\n",
        "of engaging him all three at once.\n",
        "He caught the sword of the first man on his ax-head and crushed in the wielder's breast with a\n",
        "murderous counterstroke before he could step back or parry. The remaining Nemedian, missing a savage\n",
        "swipe, had his brains dashed out before he could recover his balance, and an instant later the Aquilonian\n",
        "was backed into a corner, desperately parrying the crashing strokes that rained about him, lacking\n",
        "opportunity even to scream for help.\n",
        "Suddenly Conan's long left arm shot out and ripped the mask from the man's head, disclosing the pallid\n",
        "features.\n",
        "\"Dog!\" grated the king. \"I thought I knew you. Traitor! Damned renegade! Even this base steel is too\n",
        "honorable for your foul head. Nay, die as thieves die!\"\n",
        "The ax fell in a devastating arc, and the Aquilonian cried out and went to his knees, grasping the severed\n",
        "stump of his right arm from which blood spouted. It had been shorn away at the elbow, and the ax,\n",
        "unchecked in its descent, had gashed deeply into his side, so that his entrails bulged out.\n",
        "\"Lie there and bleed to death,\" grunted Conan, casting the ax away disgustedly. \"Come, Countess!\"\n",
        "Stooping, he slashed the cords that bound her wrists and lifting her as if she had been a child, strode from\n",
        "the dungeon. She was sobbing hysterically, with her arms thrown about his corded neck in a frenzied\n",
        "embrace.\n",
        "\"Easy all,\" he muttered. \"We're not out of this yet. If we can reach the dungeon where the secret door\n",
        "opens on stairs that lead to the tunnel--devil take it, they've heard that noise, even through these walls.\"\n",
        "Down the corridor arms clanged and the tramp and shouting of men echoed under the vaulted roof. A\n",
        "bent figure came hobbling swiftly along, lantern held high, and its light shone full on Conan and the girl.\n",
        "With a curse the Cimmerian sprang toward him, but the old watchman, abandoning both lantern and\n",
        "pike, scuttled away down the corridor, screeching for help at the top of his cracked voice. Deeper shouts\n",
        "answered him.\n",
        "Conan turned swiftly and ran the other way. He was cut off from the dungeon with the secret lock and\n",
        "the hidden door through which he had entered the Tower, and by which he had hoped to leave, but he\n",
        "knew this grim building well. Before he was king he had been imprisoned in it.\n",
        "He turned off into a side passage and quickly emerged into another, broader corridor, which ran parallel\n",
        "to the one down which he had come, and which was at the moment deserted. He followed this only a few \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "512\n",
        "yards, when he again turned back, down another side passage. This brought him back into the corridor\n",
        "he had left, but at a strategic point. A few feet farther up the corridor there was a heavy bolted door, and\n",
        "before it stood a bearded Nemedian in corselet and helmet his back to Conan as he peered up the corridor\n",
        "in the direction of the growing tumult and wildly waving lanterns.\n",
        "Conan did not hesitate. Slipping the girl to the ground, he ran at the guard swiftly and silently, sword in\n",
        "hand. The man turned just as the king reached him, bawled in surprize and fright and lifted his pike; but\n",
        "before he could bring the clumsy weapon into play, Conan brought down his sword on the fellow's\n",
        "helmet with a force that would have felled an ox. Helmet and skull gave way together and the guard\n",
        "crumpled to the floor.\n",
        "In an instant Conan had drawn the massive bolt that barred the door-- too heavy for one ordinary man to\n",
        "have manipulated--and called hastily to Albiona, who ran staggering to him. Catching her up\n",
        "unceremoniously with one arm, he bore her through the door and into the outer darkness.\n",
        "They had come into a narrow alley, black as pitch, walled by the side of the Tower on one hand, and the\n",
        "sheer stone back of a row of buildings on the other. Conan, hurrying through the darkness as swiftly as\n",
        "he dared, felt the latter wall for doors or windows, but found none.\n",
        "The great door clanged open behind them, and men poured out, with torches gleaming on breastplates\n",
        "and naked swords. They glared about, bellowing, unable to penetrate the darkness which their torches\n",
        "served to illuminate for only a few feet in any direction, and then rushed down the alley at random--\n",
        "heading in the direction opposite to that taken by Conan and Albiona.\n",
        "\"They'll learn their mistake quick enough,\" he muttered, increasing his pace. \"If we ever find a crack in\n",
        "this infernal wall--damn! The street watch!\"\n",
        "Ahead of them a faint glow became apparent, where the alley opened into a narrow street, and he saw\n",
        "dim figures looming against it with a glimmer of steel. It was indeed the street watch, investigating the\n",
        "noise they had heard echoing down the alley.\n",
        "\"Who goes here?\" they shouted, and Conan grit his teeth at the hated Nemedian accent.\n",
        "\"Keep behind me,\" he ordered the girl. \"We've got to cut our way through before the prison guards come\n",
        "back and pin us between them.\"\n",
        "And grasping his sword, he ran straight at the oncoming figures.\n",
        "The advantage of surprize was his. He could see them, limned against the distant glow, and they could\n",
        "not see him coming at them out of the black depths of the alley. He was among them before they knew it,\n",
        "smiting with the silent fury of a wounded lion.\n",
        "His one chance lay in hacking through before they could gather their wits. But there were half a score of\n",

        "\"Fear not, my lady,\" said their guide. \"There is nothing here to harm you, vulgar superstition to the\n",

        "that route. Others, myself among them, surrounded the tower. And now, King Conan, it is yours to\n",

        "temples in a remarkable fashion. The worship of Mitra was overwhelmingly predominant in the\n",
        "Hyborian nations, but the cult of Asura persisted, in spite of official ban and popular antagonism. Conan\n",
        "had been told dark tales of hidden temples where intense smoke drifted up incessantly from black altars\n",
        "where kidnaped humans were sacrificed before a great coiled serpent, whose fearsome head swayed for\n",
        "ever in the haunted shadows.\n",
        "Persecution caused the followers of Asura to hide their temples with cunning art, and to veil they rituals\n",
        "in obscurity; and this secrecy, in turn, evoked more monstrous suspicions and tales of evil.\n",
        "But Conan's was the broad tolerance of the barbarian, and he had refused to persecute the followers of\n",
        "Asura or to allow the people to do so on no better evidence than was presented against them, rumors and\n",
        "accusations that could not be proven. \"If they are black magicians,\" he had said, \"how will they suffer you\n",

        "another, but she preferred to sit on a golden stool at his feet, pressing close against his thigh, as if seeking\n",
        "security in the contact. Like most orthodox followers of Mitra, she had an intuitive horror of the followers\n",

        "Hadrathus stood before them, his uncovered head bowed.\n",
        "\"What is your wish, Your Majesty? \"\n",
        "\"Food first,\" he grunted, and the priest smote a golden gong with a silver wand.\n",

        "\"It is not alone the rebellious lords of Aquilonia and the armies of Nemedia which are arrayed against\n",
        "you,\" answered Hadrathus. \"It is sorcery--grisly black magic from the grim youth of the world. An awful\n",
        "shape has risen out of the shades of the Past, and none can stand before it.\"\n",
        "\"What do you mean?\" Conan repeated.\n",
        "\"I speak of Xaltotun of Acheron, who died three thousand years ago, yet walks the earth today.\"\n",
        "Conan was silent, while in his mind floated an image--the image of a bearded face of calm inhuman\n",
        "beauty. Again he was haunted by a sense of uneasy familiarity. Acheron--the sound of the word roused\n",
        "instinctive vibrations of memory and associations in his mind.\n",
        "\"Acheron,\" he repeated. \"Xaltotun of Acheron--man, are you mad? Acheron has been a myth for more\n",
        "centuries than I can remember. I've often wondered if it ever existed at all.\"\n",
        "\"It was a black reality,\" answered Hadrathus, \"an empire of black magicians, steeped in evil now long\n",
        "forgotten. It was finally overthrown by the Hyborian tribes of the west. The wizards of Acheron practised\n",
        "foul necromancy, thaumaturgy of the most evil kind, grisly magic taught them by devils. And of all the\n",
        "sorcerers of that accursed kingdom, none was so great as Xaltotun of Python.\"\n",
        "\"Then how was he ever overthrown?\" asked Conan skeptically.\n",
        "\"By some means a source of cosmic power which he jealously guarded was stolen and turned against him.\n",
        "That source has been returned to him, and he is invincible.\"\n",
        "Albiona, hugging the headsman's black cloak about her, stared from the priest to the king, not\n",
        "understanding the conversation. Conan shook his head angrily.\n",
        "\"You are making game of me,\" he growled. \"If Xaltotun has been dead three thousand years, how can this\n",
        "man be he? It's some rogue who's taken the old one's name.\"\n",
        "Hadrathus leaned to an ivory table and opened a small gold chest which stood there. From it he took\n",
        "something which glinted dully in the mellow light--a broad gold coin of antique minting.\n",
        "\"You have seen Xaltotun unveiled? Then look upon this. It is a coin which was stamped in ancient\n",
        "Acheron, before its fall. So pervaded with sorcery was that black empire, that even this coin has its uses in\n",
        "making magic.\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "517\n",
        "Conan took it and scowled down at it. There was no mistaking its great antiquity. Conan had handled\n",
        "many coins in the years of his plunderings, and had a good practical knowledge of them. The edges were\n",
        "worn and the inscription almost obliterated. But the countenance stamped on one side was still clear-cut\n",
        "and distinct. And Conan's breath sucked in between his clenched teeth. It was not cool in the chamber,\n",
        "but he felt a prickling of his scalp, an icy contraction of his flesh. The countenance was that of a bearded\n",
        "man, inscrutable, with a calm inhuman beauty.\n",
        "\"By Crom! It's he!\" muttered Conan. He understood, now, the sense of familiarity that the sight of the\n",
        "bearded man had roused in him from the first. He had seen a coin like this once before, long ago in a far\n",
        "land.\n",
        "With a shake of his shoulders he growled: \"The likeness is only a coincidence--or if he's shrewd enough to\n",
        "assume a forgotten wizard's name, he's shrewd enough to assume his likeness.\" But he spoke without\n",
        "conviction. The sight of that coin had shaken the foundations of his universe. He felt that reality and\n",
        "stability were crumbling into an abyss of illusion and sorcery. A wizard was understandable; but this was\n",
        "diabolism beyond sanity.\n",
        "\"We cannot doubt that it is indeed Xaltotun of Python,\" said Hadrathus. \"He it was who shook down the\n",
        "cliffs at Valkia, by his spells that enthrall the elementals of the earth--he it was who sent the creature of\n",
        "darkness into your tent before dawn.\"\n",
        "Conan scowled at him. \"How did you know that?\"\n",
        "\"The followers of Asura have secret channels of knowledge. That does not matter. But do you realize the\n",
        "futility of sacrificing your subjects in a vain attempt to regain your crown?\"\n",
        "Conan rested his chin on his fist, and stared grimly into nothing. Albiona watched him anxiously, her\n",
        "mind groping bewildered in the mazes of the problem that confronted him.\n",
        "\"Is there no wizard in the world who could make magic to fight Xaltotun's magic?\" he asked at last.\n",
        "Hadrathus shook his head. \"If there were, we of Asura would know of him. Men say our cult is a survival\n",
        "of the ancient Stygian serpent- worship. That is a lie. Our ancestors came from Vendhya, beyond the Sea\n",
        "of Vilayet and the blue Himelian mountains. We are sons of the East, not the South, and we have\n",

        "that it is not stolen again.\"\n",
        "\"And what is this damnable source?\" demanded Conan irritably.\n",
        "\"It is called the Heart of Ahriman. When Acheron was overthrown, the primitive priest who had stolen it\n",
        "and turned it against Xaltotun hid it in a haunted cavern and built a small temple over the cavern. Thrice\n",
        "thereafter the temple was rebuilt, each time greater and more elaborately than before, but always on the\n",
        "site of the original shrine, though men forgot the reason therefor. Memory of the hidden symbol faded\n",
        "from the minds of common men, and was preserved only in priestly books and esoteric volumes. Whence \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "518\n",
        "it came no one knows. Some say it is the veritable heart of a god, others that it is a star that fell from the\n",
        "skies long ago. Until it was stolen, none had looked upon it for three thousand years.\n",
        "\"When the magic of the Mitran priests failed against the magic of Xaltotun's acolyte, Altaro, they\n",
        "remembered the ancient legend of the Heart, and the high priest and an acolyte went down into the dark\n",
        "and terrible crypt below the temple into which no priest had descended for three thousand years. In the\n",
        "ancient iron-bound volumes which speak of the Heart in their cryptic symbolism, it is also told of a\n",

        "\"Far down in a square chamber with arched doorways leading off into immeasurable blackness, the priest\n",
        "and his acolytes found a black stone altar that glowed dimly with inexplicable radiance.\n",
        "\"On that altar lay a curious gold vessel like a double-valved seashell, which clung to the stone like a\n",
        "barnacle. But it gaped open and empty. The Heart of Ahriman was gone. While they stared in horror, the\n",
        "keeper of the crypt, the creature of darkness, came upon them and mangled the high priest so that he\n",
        "died. But the acolyte fought off the being--a mindless, soulless waif of the pits brought long ago to guard\n",
        "the Heart--and escaped up the long black narrow stairs carrying the dying priest, who before he died,\n",
        "gasped out the news to his followers, bade them submit to a power they could not overcome, and\n",
        "commanded secrecy. But the word has been whispered about among the priests, and we of Asura learned\n",
        "of it.\"\n",
        "\"And Xaltotun draws his power from this symbol?\" asked Conan, still skeptical.\n",
        "\"No. His power is drawn from the black gulf. But the Heart of Ahriman came from some far universe of\n",
        "flaming light, and against it the powers of darkness cannot stand, when it is in the hands of an adept. It is\n",
        "like a sword that might smite at him, not a sword with which he can smite. It restores life, and can\n",
        "destroy life. He has stolen it, not to use it against his enemies, but to keep them from using it against\n",
        "him.\"\n",
        "\"A shell-shaped bowl of gold on a black altar in a deep cavern,\" Conan muttered, frowning as he sought\n",

        "name, is this notable Heart?\"\n",
        "\"It is in the form of a great jewel, like a ruby, but pulsing with blinding fire with which no ruby ever\n",

        "\"What are you saying? The Heart stolen from Xaltotun?\"\n",
        "\"Aye!\" Conan boomed. \"Tarascus feared Xaltotun and wanted to cripple his power, which he thought\n",

        "\"The sea will not hold it!\" exclaimed Hadrathus, quivering with excitement. \"Xaltotun would himself\n",

        "\"Well,\" Conan was recovering some of his resilient confidence, \"there's no assurance that the thief will\n",

        "throw it away. He'll sell it to some rich trader. By Crom!\" He strode back and forth in his growing\n",
        "excitement. \"It's worth looking for! Zelata bade me find the heart of my kingdom, and all else she showed\n",

        "\"Aye! My head upon it!\" cried Hadrathus, his face lightened with fervor, his eyes blazing, his fists\n",
        "clenched. \"With it in our hands we can dare the powers of Xaltotun! I swear it! If we can recover it, we\n",
        "have an even chance of recovering your crown and driving the invaders from our portals. It is not the\n",

        "Conan looked at him for a space, impressed by the priest's fire.\n",
        "\"It's like a quest in a nightmare,\" he said at last. \"Yet your words echo the thought of Zeiata, and all else\n",

        "\"And if you find the Heart,\" cried Hadrathus, \"I will prepare the way for your conquest. Before you\n",

        "more terrible than ever. The alley behind the tower is full of dead men. Beware, Valerius--he has come\n",

        "swiftly to the door, cast it open suddenly. The messenger and a group of Nemedian guardsmen stood\n",
        "several paces down the corridor. Valerius muttered something that might have indicated satisfaction.\n",

        "\"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n",

        "Returning to his palace chamber, Valerius summoned before him four men of curious and alien aspect.\n",

        "toward the summits that castellated the sky.\n",
        "The rolling country at the foot of the towering mountains were now a borderland, in a state of turmoil,\n",
        "where the barons reverted to feudal practises, and bands of outlaws roamed unhindered. Poitain had not\n",
        "formally declared her separation from Aquilonia, but she was now, to all intents, a self-contained\n",
        "kingdom, ruled by her hereditary count, Trocero. The rolling south country had submitted nominally to\n",
        "Valerius, but he had not attempted to force the passes guarded by strongholds where the crimson leopard\n",

        "The king and his fair companion rode up the long blue slopes in the soft evening. As they mounted\n",
        "higher, the rolling country spread out like a vast purple mantle far beneath them, shot with the shine of\n",
        "rivers and lakes, the yellow glint of broad fields, and the white gleam of distant towers. Ahead of them\n",
        "and far above, they glimpsed the first of the Poitanian holds--a strong fortress dominating a narrow pass,\n",
        "the crimson banner streaming against the clear blue sky.\n",
        "Before they reached it, a band of knights in burnished armor rode from among the trees, and their leader\n",

        "\"Halt, sir, and state your business, and why you ride toward Poitain.\"\n",
        "\"Is Poitain in revolt then,\" asked Conan, watching the other closely, \"that a man in Aquilonian harness is\n",
        "halted and questioned like a foreigner?\"\n",
        "\"Many rogues ride out of Aquilonia these days,\" answered the other coldly. \"As for revolt, if you mean\n",

        "than the scepter of a living dog.\"\n",
        "Conan swept off his helmet, and shaking back his black mane stared full at the speaker. The Poitanian\n",

        "\"Saints of heaven!\" he gasped. \"It is the king--alive!\"\n",
        "The others stared wildly, then a roar of wonder and joy burst from them. They swarmed about Conan,\n",
        "shouting their war-cries and brandishing their swords in their extreme emotion. The acclaim of Poitanian\n",
        "warriors was a thing to terrify a timid man.\n",
        "\"Oh, but Trocero will weep tears of joy to see you, sire!\" cried one.\n",

        "and curses himself night and day that he did not reach the Valkia in time to die beside his king!\"\n",
        "\"Now we will strike for empery!\" yelled another, whirling his great sword about his head. \"Hail, Conan\n",
        "king of Poitain!\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "524\n",
        "The clangor of bright steel about him and the thunder of their acclaim frightened the birds that rose in\n",
        "gay-hued clouds from the surrounding trees. The hot southern blood was afire, and they desired nothing\n",
        "but for their new-found sovereign to lead them to battle and pillage.\n",
        "\"What is your command, sire?\" they cried. \"Let one of us ride ahead and bear the news of your coming\n",
        "into Poitain! Banners will wave from every tower, roses will carpet the road before your horse's feet, and\n",
        "all the beauty and chivalry of the south will give you the honor due you--\"\n",
        "Conan shook his head.\n",
        "\"Who could doubt your loyalty? But winds blow over these mountains into the countries of my enemies,\n",
        "and I would rather these didn't know that I lived--yet. Take me to Trocero, and keep my identity a secret.\"\n",
        "So what the knights would have made a triumphal procession was more in the nature of a secret flight.\n",
        "They traveled in haste, speaking to no one, except for a whisper to the captain on duty at each pass; and\n",
        "Conan rode among them with his vizor lowered.\n",
        "The mountains were uninhabited save by outlaws and garrisons of soldiers who guarded the passes. The\n",
        "pleasure-loving Poitanians had no need nor desire to wrest a hard and scanty living from their stern\n",
        "breasts. South of the ranges the rich and beautiful plains of Poitain stretched to the river Alimane; but\n",
        "beyond the river lay the land of Zingara.\n",
        "Even now, when winter was crisping the leaves beyond the mountains, the tall rich grass waved upon the\n",
        "plains where grazed the horses and cattle for which Poitain was famed. Palm trees and orange groves\n",
        "smiled in the sun, and the gorgeous purple and gold and crimson towers of castles and cities reflected the\n",
        "golden light. It was a land of warmth and plenty, of beautiful men and ferocious warriors. It is not only\n",
        "the hard lands that breed hard men. Poitain was surrounded by covetous neighbors and her sons learned\n",
        "hardihood in incessant wars. To the north the land was guarded by the mountains, but to the south only\n",
        "the Alimane separated the plains of Poitain from the plains of Zingara, and not once but a thousand times\n",
        "had that river run red. To the east lay Argos and beyond that Ophir, proud kingdoms and avaricious. The\n",
        "knights of Poitain held their lands by the weight and edge of their swords, and little of ease and idleness\n",
        "they knew.\n",
        "So Conan came presently to the castle of Count Trocero.\n",
        "Conan sat on a silken divan in a rich chamber whose filmy curtains the warm breeze billowed. Trocero\n",
        "paced the floor like a panther, a lithe, restless man with the waist of a woman and the shoulders of a\n",
        "swordsman, who carried his years lightly.\n",
        "\"Let us proclaim you king of Poitain!\" urged the count. \"Let those northern pigs wear the yoke to which\n",
        "they have bent their necks. The south is still yours. Dwell here and rule us, amid the flowers and the\n",
        "palms.\"\n",
        "But Conan shook his head. \"There is no nobler land on earth than Poitain. But it cannot stand alone, bold\n",
        "as are its sons.\"\n",
        "\"It did stand alone for generations,\" retorted Trocero, with the quick jealous pride of his breed. \"We were\n",
        "not always a part of Aquilonia.\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "525\n",
        "\"I know. But conditions are not as they were then, when all kingdoms were broken into principalities\n",
        "which warred with each other. The days of dukedoms and free cities are past, the days of empires are\n",
        "upon us. Rulers are dreaming imperial dreams, and only in unity is there strength.\"\n",
        "\"Then let us unite Zingara with Poitain,\" argued Trocero. \"Half a dozen princes strive against each other,\n",
        "and the country is torn asunder by civil wars. We will conquer it, province by province, and add it to\n",
        "your dominions. Then with the aid of the Zingarans we will conquer Argos and Ophir. We will build an\n",
        "empire--\"\n",
        "Again Conan shook his head. \"Let others dream imperial dreams. I but wish to hold what is mine. I have\n",
        "no desire to rule an empire welded together by blood and fire. It's one thing to seize a throne with the aid\n",
        "of its subjects and rule them with their consent. It's another to subjugate a foreign realm and rule it by\n",
        "fear. I don't wish to be another Valerius. No, Trocero, I'll rule all Aquilonia and no more, or I'll rule\n",
        "nothing.\"\n",
        "\"Then lead us over the mountains and we will smite the Nemedians.\"\n",
        "Conan's fierce eyes glowed with appreciation. \"No, Trocero. It would be a vain sacrifice. I've told you\n",
        "what I must do to regain my kingdom. I must find the Heart of Ahriman.\"\n",
        "\"But this is madness!\" protested Trocero. \"The maunderings of a heretical priest, the mumblings of a mad\n",
        "witch-woman.\"\n",
        "\"You were not in my tent before Valkia,\" answered Conan grimly, involuntarily glancing at his right wrist,\n",
        "on which blue marks still showed faintly. \"You didn't see the cliffs thunder down to crush the flower of\n",
        "my army. No, Trocero, I've been convinced. Xaltotun's no mortal man, and only with the Heart of\n",
        "Ahriman can I stand against him. So I'm riding to Kordava, alone.\"\n",
        "\"But that is dangerous,\" protested Trocero.\n",
        "\"Life is dangerous,\" rumbled the king. \"I won't go as king of Aquilonia, or even as a knight of Poitain, but\n",
        "as a wandering mercenary, as I rode in Zingara in the old days. Oh, I have enemies enough south of the\n",
        "Alimane, in the lands and the waters of the south. Many who won't know me as king of Aquilonia will\n",
        "remember me as Conan of the Barachan pirates, or Amra of the black corsairs. But I have friends, too, and\n",
        "men who'll aid me for their own private reasons.\" A faint reminiscent grin touched his lips.\n",
        "Trocero dropped his hands helplessly and glanced at Albiona, who sat on a near-by divan.\n",
        "\"I understand your doubts, my lord,\" said she. \"But I too saw the coin in the temple of Asura, and look\n",
        "you, Hadrathus said it was dated five hundred years before the fall of Acheron. If Xaltotun, then, is the\n",
        "man pictured on the coin, as his Majesty swears he is, that means he was no common wizard, even in his\n",

        "numbered.\"\n",
        "Before Trocero could reply, a respectful rap was heard on the door and a voice called: \"My lord, we have\n",
        "caught a man skulking about the castle, who says he wishes to speak with your guest. I await your\n",
        "orders.\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "526\n",
        "\"A spy from Aquilonia!\" hissed Trocero, catching at his dagger, but Conan lifted his voice and called:\n",

        "The door was opened and a man was framed in it, grasped on either hand by stern-looking men-at-arms.\n",
        "He was a slender man, clad in a dark hooded robe.\n",
        "\"Are you a follower of Asura?\" asked Conan.\n",
        "The man nodded, and the stalwart men-at-arms looked shocked and glanced hesitantly at Trocero.\n",
        "\"The word came southward,\" said the man. \"Beyond the Alimane we cannot aid you, for our sect goes no\n",
        "farther southward, but stretches eastward with the Khorotas. But this I have learned: the thief who took\n",
        "the Heart of Ahriman from Tarascus never reached Kordava. In the mountains of Poitain he was slain by\n",
        "robbers. The jewel fell into the hands of their chief, who, not knowing its true nature, and being harried\n",
        "after the destruction of his band by Poitanian knights, sold it to the Kothic merchant Zorathus.\"\n",
        "\"Ha!\" Conan was on his feet, galvanized. \"And what of Zorathus?\"\n",

        "\"He's a fool to cross Zingara in such times,\" said Trocero.\n",

        "great haste to reach Messantia, where he hopes to find a buyer for the jewel. Perhaps he hopes to sell it\n",

        "plain morion, dented and battered. The leather and mail mesh of his hauberk were worn and shiny as if\n",
        "by many campaigns, and the scarlet cloak flowing carelessly from his mailed shoulders was tattered and\n",
        "stained. He looked the part of the hired fighting-man, who had known all vicissitudes of fortune, plunder\n",

        "And more than looking the part, he felt the part; the awakening of old memories, the resurge of the wild,\n",
        "mad, glorious days of old before his feet were set on the imperial path when he was a wandering\n",
        "mercenary, roistering, brawling, guzzling, adventuring, with no thought for the morrow, and no desire\n",
        "save sparkling ale, red lips, and a keen sword to swing on all the battlefields of the world.\n",
        "Unconsciously he reverted to the old ways; a new swagger became evident in his bearing, in the way he\n",
        "sat his horse; half-forgotten oaths rose naturally to his lips, and as he rode he hummed old songs that he\n",

        "It was an unquiet land through which he rode. The companies of cavalry which usually patrolled the\n",

        "unguarded: The long white road stretched bare from horizon to horizon. No laden camel trains or\n",
        "rumbling wagons or lowing herds moved along it now; only occasional groups of horsemen in leather\n",

        "Villages lay in ashes and deserted, the fields and meadows idle. Only the boldest would ride the roads\n",
        "these days, and the native population had been decimated in the civil wars, and by raids from across the\n",
        "river. In more peaceful times the road was thronged with merchants riding to Messantia in Argos, or back.\n",
        "But now these found it wiser to follow the road that led east through Poitain, and then turned south\n",
        "down across Argos. It was longer, but safer. Only an extremely reckless man would risk his life and\n",
        "goods on this road through Zingara.\n",

        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "528\n",
        "faster than the burdened merchants could travel. And so he came to the castle of Count Valbroso,\n",
        "perched like a vulture's eyrie on a bare hill overlooking the road.\n",
        "Valbroso rode down with his men-at-arms, a lean, dark man with glittering eyes and a predatory beak of\n",
        "a nose. He wore black plate armor and was followed by thirty spearmen, black-mustached hawks of the\n",
        "border wars, as avaricious and ruthless as himself. Of late the toll of the caravans had been slim, and\n",
        "Valbroso cursed the civil wars that stripped the roads of their fat traffic, even while he blessed them for\n",

        "He had not hoped much from the solitary rider he had glimpsed from his tower, but all was grist that\n",

        "conclusions were the same as those of the riders who had passed the Cimmerian on the road--an empty\n",
        "purse and a ready blade.\n",
        "\"Who are you, knave?\" he demanded.\n",
        "\"A mercenary, riding for Argos,\" answered Conan. \"What matter names?\"\n",
        "\"You are riding in the wrong direction for a Free Companion,\" grunted Valbroso. \"Southward the fighting\n",
        "is good and also the plundering. Join my company. You won't go hungry. The road remains bare of fat\n",
        "merchants to strip, but I mean to take my rogues and fare southward to sell our swords to whichever side\n",
        "seems strongest.\"\n",
        "Conan did not at once reply, knowing that if he refused outright, he might be instantly attacked by\n",
        "Valbroso's men-at-arms. Before he could make up his mind, the Zingaran spoke again:\n",
        "\"You rogues of the Free Companies always know tricks to make men talk. I have a prisoner--the last\n",
        "merchant I caught, by Mitra, and the only one I've seen for a week--and the knave is stubborn. He has an\n",
        "iron box, the secret of which defies us, and I've been unable to persuade him to open it. By Ishtar, I\n",
        "thought I knew all the modes of persuasion there are, but perhaps you, as a veteran Free Companion,\n",
        "know some that I do not. At any rate come with me and see what you may do.\"\n",
        "Valbroso's words instantly decided Conan. That sounded a great deal like Zorathus. Conan did not know\n",
        "the merchant, but any man who was stubborn enough to try to traverse the Zingaran road in times like\n",
        "these would very probably be stubborn enough to defy torture.\n",
        "He fell in beside Valbroso and rode up the straggling road to the top of the hill where the gaunt castle\n",
        "stood. As a man-at-arms he should have ridden behind the count, but force of habit made him careless\n",
        "and Valbroso paid no heed. Years of life on the border had taught the count that the frontier is not the\n",
        "royal court. He was aware of the independence of the mercenaries, behind whose swords many a king\n",
        "had trodden the throne-path.\n",
        "There was a dry moat, half filled with debris in some places. They clattered across the drawbridge and\n",
        "through the arch of the gate. Behind them the portcullis fell with a sullen clang. They came into a bare\n",
        "courtyard, grown with straggling grass, and with a well in the middle. Shacks for the men-at-arms\n",
        "straggled about the bailey wall, and women, slatternly or decked in gaudy finery, looked from the doors.\n",
        "Fighting-men in rusty mail tossed dice on the flags under the arches. It was more like a bandit's hold than\n",
        "the castle of a nobleman.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "529\n",
        "Valbroso dismounted and motioned Conan to follow him. They went through a doorway and along a\n",
        "vaulted corridor, where they were met by a scarred, hard-looking man in mail descending a stone\n",
        "staircase-- evidently the captain of the guard.\n",
        "\"How, Beloso,\" quoth Valbroso; \"has he spoken?\"\n",
        "\"He is stubborn,\" muttered Beloso, shooting a glance of suspicion at Conan.\n",
        "Valbroso ripped out an oath and stamped furiously up the winding stair, followed by Conan and the\n",
        "captain. As they mounted, the groans of a man in mortal agony became audible. Valbroso's torture-room\n",
        "was high above the court, instead of in a dungeon below. In that chamber, where a gaunt, hairy beast of a\n",
        "man in leather breeks squatted gnawing a beef bone voraciously, stood the machines of torture--racks,\n",
        "boots, hooks and all the implements that the human mind devises to tear flesh, break bones and rend and\n",
        "rupture veins and ligaments.\n",
        "On a rack a man was stretched naked, and a glance told Conan that he was dying. The unnatural\n",
        "elongation of his limbs and body told of unhinged joints and unnamable ruptures. He was a dark man,\n",
        "with an intelligent, aquiline face and quick dark eyes. They were glazed and bloodshot now with pain,\n",
        "and the dew of agony glistened on his face. His lips were drawn back from blackened gums.\n",
        "\"There is the box.\" Viciously Valbroso kicked a small but heavy iron chest that stood on the floor near by.\n",
        "It was intricately carved, with tiny skulls and writhing dragons curiously intertwined, but Conan saw no\n",
        "catch or hasp that might serve to unlock the lid. The marks of fire, of ax and sledge and chisel showed on\n",
        "it but as scratches.\n",
        "\"This is the dog's treasure box,\" said Valbroso angrily. \"All men of the south know of Zorathus and his\n",
        "iron chest. Mitra knows what is in it. But he will not give up its secret.\"\n",
        "Zorathus! It was true, then; the man he sought lay before him. Conan's heart beat suffocatingly as he\n",
        "leaned over the writhing form, though he exhibited no evidence of his painful eagerness.\n",
        "\"Ease those ropes, knave!\" he ordered the torturer harshly, and Valbroso and his captain stared. In the\n",
        "forgetfulness of the moment Conan had used his imperial tone, and the brute in leather instinctively\n",
        "obeyed the knife edge of command in that voice. He eased away gradually, for else the slackening of the\n",
        "ropes had been as great a torment to the torn joints as further stretching.\n",
        "Catching up a vessel of wine that stood near by, Conan placed the rim to the wretch's lips. Zorathus\n",
        "gulped spasmodically, the liquid slopping over on his heaving breast.\n",
        "Into the bloodshot eyes came a gleam of recognition, and the froth- smeared lips parted. From them\n",
        "issued a racking whimper in the Kothic tongue.\n",
        "\"Is this death, then? Is the long agony ended? For this is King Conan who died at Valkia, and I am among\n",
        "the dead.\"\n",
        "\"You're not dead,\" said Conan. \"But you're dying. You'll be tortured no more. I'll see to that. But I can't\n",
        "help you further. Yet before you die, tell me how to open your iron box!\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "530\n",
        "\"My iron box,\" mumbled Zorathus in delirious disjointed phrases. \"The chest forged in unholy fires\n",
        "among the flaming mountains of Khrosha; the metal no chisel can cut. How many treasures has it borne,\n",
        "across the width and the breadth of the world! But no such treasure as it now holds.\"\n",
        "\"Tell me how to open it,\" urged Conan. \"It can do you no good, and it may aid me.\"\n",
        "\"Aye, you are Conan,\" muttered the Kothian. \"I have seen you sitting on your throne in the great public\n",
        "hall of Tarantia, with your crown on your head and the scepter in your hand. But you are dead; you died\n",
        "at Valkia. And so I know my own end is at hand.\"\n",
        "\"What does the dog say?\" demanded Valbroso impatiently, not understanding Kothic. \"Will he tell us\n",
        "how to open the box?\"\n",
        "As if the voice roused a spark of life in the twisted breast, Zorathus rolled his bloodshot eyes toward the\n",
        "speaker.\n",
        "\"Only Valbroso will I tell,\" he gasped in Zingaran. \"Death is upon me. Lean close to me, Valbroso!\"\n",
        "The count did so, his dark face lit with avarice; behind him his saturnine captain, Beloso, crowded closer.\n",
        "\"Press the seven skulls on the rim, one after another,\" gasped Zorathus. \"Press then the head of the\n",
        "dragon that writhes across the lid. Then press the sphere in the dragon's claws. That will release the secret\n",
        "catch.\"\n",
        "\"Quick, the box!\" cried Valbroso with an oath.\n",
        "Conan lifted it and set it on a dais, and Valbroso shouldered him aside.\n",
        "\"Let me open it!\" cried Beloso, starting forward.\n",
        "Valbroso cursed him back, his greed blazing in his black eyes.\n",
        "\"None but me shall open it!\" he cried.\n",
        "Conan, whose hand had instinctively gone to his hilt, glanced at Zorathus. The man's eyes were glazed\n",
        "and bloodshot, but they were fixed on Valbroso with burning intensity; and was there the shadow of a\n",
        "grim twisted smile on the dying man's lips? Not until the merchant knew he was dying had he given up\n",
        "the secret. Conan turned to watch Valbroso, even as the dying man watched him.\n",
        "Along the rim of the lid seven skulls were carved among intertwining branches of strange trees. An inlaid\n",
        "dragon writhed its way across the top of the lid, amid ornate arabesques. Valbroso pressed the skulls in\n",
        "rumbling haste, and as he jammed his thumb down on the carved head of the dragon he swore sharply\n",
        "and snatched his hand away, shaking it in irritation.\n",
        "\"A sharp point on the carvings,\" he snarled. \"I've pricked my thumb.\"\n",
        "He pressed the gold ball clutched in the dragon's talons, and the lid flew abruptly open. Their eyes were\n",
        "dazzled by a golden flame. It seemed to their dazed minds that the carven box was full of glowing fire\n",
        "that spilled over the rim and dripped through the air in quivering flakes. Beloso cried out and Valbroso\n",
        "sucked in his breath. Conan stood speechless, his brain snared by the blaze.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "531\n",
        "\"Mitra, what a jewel!\" Valbroso's hand dived into the chest, came out with a great pulsing crimson sphere\n",
        "that filled the room with a lambent glow. In its glare Valbroso looked like a corpse. And the dying man\n",
        "on the loosened rack laughed wildly and suddenly.\n",
        "\"Fool!\" he screamed. \"The jewel is yours! I give you death with it! The scratch on your thumb--look at the\n",
        "dragon's head, Valbroso!\"\n",
        "They all wheeled, stared. Something tiny and dully gleaming stood up from the gaping, carved mouth.\n",
        "\"The dragon's fang!\" shrieked Zorathus. \"Steeped in the venom of the black Stygian scorpion! Fool, fool to\n",
        "open the box of Zorathus with your naked hand! Death! You are a dead man now!\"\n",
        "And with bloody foam on his lips he died.\n",
        "Valbroso staggered, crying out. \"Ah, Mitra, I burn!\" he shrieked. \"My veins race with liquid fire! My joints\n",
        "are bursting asunder! Death! Death!\" And he reeled and crashed headlong. There was an instant of awful\n",
        "convulsions, in which the limbs were twisted into hideous and unnatural positions, and then in that\n",
        "posture the man froze, his glassy eyes staring sightlessly upward, his lips drawn back from blackened\n",
        "gums.\n",
        "\"Dead!\" muttered Conan, stooping to pick up the jewel where it rolled on the floor from Valbroso's rigid\n",
        "hand. It lay on the floor like a quivering pool of sunset fire.\n",
        "\"Dead!\" muttered Beloso, with madness in his eyes. And then he moved.\n",
        "Conan was caught off guard, his eyes dazzled, his brain dazed by the blaze of the great gem. He did not\n",
        "realize Beloso's intention until something crashed with terrible force upon his helmet. The glow of the\n",
        "jewel was splashed with redder flame, and he went to his knees under the blow.\n",
        "He heard a rush of feet, a bellow of oxlike agony. He was stunned but not wholly senseless, and realized\n",
        "that Beloso had caught up the iron box and crashed it down on his head as he stooped. Only his basinet\n",
        "had saved his skull. He staggered up, drawing his sword, trying to shake the dimness out of his eyes. The\n",
        "room swam to his dizzy gaze. But the door was open and fleet footsteps were dwindling down the\n",
        "winding stair. On the floor the brutish torturer was gasping out his life with a great gash under his breast.\n",
        "And the Heart of Ahriman was gone.\n",
        "Conan reeled out of the chamber, sword in hand, blood streaming down his face from under his burganet.\n",
        "He ran drunkenly down the steps, hearing a clang of steel in the courtyard below, shouts, then the frantic\n",
        "drum of hoofs. Rushing into the bailey he saw the men-at-arms milling about confusedly, while women\n",
        "screeched. The postern gate stood open and a soldier lay across his pike with his head split. Horses, still\n",
        "bridled and saddled, ran neighing about the court, Conan's black stallion among them.\n",
        "\"He's mad!\" howled a woman, wringing her hands as she rushed brainlessly about. \"He came out of the\n",
        "castle like a mad dog, hewing right and left! Beloso's mad! Where's Lord Valbroso?\"\n",
        "\"Which way did he go?\" roared Conan. All turned and stared at the stranger's bloodstained face and\n",
        "naked sword. \"Through the postern!\" shrilled a woman, pointing eastward, and another bawled: \"Who is\n",
        "this rogue?\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "532\n",
        "\"Beloso has killed Valbroso!\" yelled Conan, leaping and seizing the stallion's mane, as the men-at-arms\n",
        "advanced uncertainly on him. A wild outcry burst forth at his news, but their reaction was exactly as he\n",
        "had anticipated. Instead of closing the gates to take him prisoner, or pursuing the fleeing slayer to avenge\n",
        "their lord, they were thrown into even greater confusion by his words. Wolves bound together only by\n",
        "fear of Valbroso, they owed no allegiance to the castle or to each other.\n",
        "Swords began to clash in the courtyard, and women screamed. And in the midst of it all, none noticed\n",
        "Conan as he shot through the postern gate and thundered down the hill. The wide plain spread before\n",
        "him, and beyond the hill the caravan road divided: one branch ran south, the other east. And on the\n",
        "eastern road he saw another rider, bending low and spurring hard. The plain swam to Conan's gaze, the\n",
        "sunlight was a thick red haze and he reeled in his saddle, grasping the flowing mane with his hand.\n",
        "Blood rained on his mail, but grimly he urged the stallion on.\n",
        "Behind him smoke began to pour out of the castle on the hill where the count's body lay forgotten and\n",
        "unheeded beside that of his prisoner. The sun was setting; against a lurid red sky the two black figures\n",
        "fled. The stallion was not fresh, but neither was the horse ridden by Beloso. But the great beast responded\n",
        "mightily, calling on deep reservoirs of reserve vitality.\n",
        "Why the Zingaran fled from one pursuer, Conan did not tax his bruised brain to guess. Perhaps\n",
        "unreasoning panic rode Beloso, born of the madness that lurked in that blazing jewel. The sun was gone;\n",
        "the white road was a dim glimmer through a ghostly twilight fading into purple gloom far ahead of him.\n",
        "The stallion panted, laboring hard. The country was changing, in the gathering dusk. Bare plains gave\n",
        "way to clumps of oaks and alders. Low hills mounted up in the distance. Stars began to blink out. The\n",
        "stallion gasped and reeled in his course. But ahead rose a dense wood that stretched to the hills on the\n",
        "horizon, and between it and himself Conan glimpsed the dim form of the fugitive. He urged on the\n",
        "distressed stallion, for he saw that he was overtaking his prey, yard by yard. Above the pounding of the\n",
        "hoofs a strange cry rose from the shadows, but neither pursuer nor pursued gave heed.\n",
        "As they swept in under the branches that overhung the road, they were almost side by side. A fierce cry\n",
        "rose from Conan's lips as his sword went up; a pale oval of a face was turned toward him, a sword\n",
        "gleamed in a half-seen hand, and Beloso echoed the cry--and then the weary stallion, with a lurch and a\n",
        "groan, missed his footing in the shadows and went heels over head, hurling his dazed rider from the\n",
        "saddle. Conan's throbbing head crashed against a stone, and the stars were blotted out in a thicker night.\n",
        "How long Conan lay senseless he never knew. His first sensation of returning consciousness was that of\n",
        "being dragged by one arm over rough and stony ground, and through dense underbrush. Then he was\n",
        "thrown carelessly down, and perhaps the jolt brought back his senses.\n",
        "His helmet was gone, his head ached abominably, he felt a qualm of nausea, and blood was clotted\n",
        "thickly among his black locks. But with the vitality of a wild thing, life and consciousness surged back\n",
        "into him, and he became aware of his surroundings.\n",
        "A broad red moon was shining through the trees, by which he knew that it was long after midnight. He\n",
        "had lain senseless for hours, long enough to have recovered from that terrible blow Beloso had dealt him,\n",
        "as well as the fall which had rendered him senseless. His brain felt clearer than it had felt during that mad\n",
        "ride after the fugitive.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "533\n",
        "He was not lying beside the white road, he noticed with a start of surprize, as his surroundings began to\n",
        "record themselves on his perceptions. The road was nowhere in sight. He lay on the grassy earth, in a\n",
        "small glade hemmed in by a black wall of tree stems and tangled branches. His face and hands were\n",
        "scratched and lacerated as if he had been dragged through brambles. Shifting his body he looked about\n",
        "him. And then he started violently--something was squatting over him.\n",
        "At first Conan doubted his consciousness, thought it was but a figment of delirium. Surely it could not be\n",
        "real, that strange, motionless gray being that squatted on its haunches and stared down at him with\n",
        "unblinking soulless eyes.\n",
        "Conan lay and stared, half expecting it to vanish like a figure of a dream, and then a chill of recollection\n",

        "drive home his dagger, again and again and again. The horrible vitality of the semihuman monstrosity\n",

        "wharves, and were hand-and-glove with every buccaneer and smuggler and pirate from here to the\n",

        "\"Meaning you're rich as hell,\" snorted Conan. \"Why? Why did you grow wealthy so much quicker than\n",
        "your competitors? Was it because you did a big business in ivory and ostrich feathers, copper and skins\n",
        "and pearls and hammered gold ornaments, and other things from the coast of Kush? And where did you\n",
        "get them so cheaply, while other merchants were paying their weight in silver to the Stygians for them?\n",
        "I'll tell you, in case you've forgotten: you bought them from me, at considerably less than their value, and\n",

        "night's work, Publio.\"\n",
        "A few moments later Publio, standing at a small outer door, watched the king's tall figure receding down\n",
        "the shadowy street.\n",
        "\"Farewell to you, corsair,\" muttered the merchant. \"This must be a notable jewel, to be sought by a man\n",
        "who has just lost a kingdom. I wish I had told my knaves to let him secure it before they did their work.\n",
        "But then, something might have gone awry. Let Argos forget Amra, and let my dealings with him be lost\n",
        "in the dust of the past. In the alley behind the house of Servio--that is where Conan will cease to be a peril\n",
        "to me.\"\n",
        "Servio's house, a dingy, ill-famed den, was located close to the wharves, facing the waterfront. It was a\n",
        "shambling building of stone and heavy ship-beams, and a long narrow alley wandered up alongside it.\n",
        "Conan made his way along the alley, and as he reached the house he had an uneasy feeling that he was\n",
        "being spied upon. He stared hard into the shadows of the squalid buildings, but saw nothing, though\n",
        "once he caught the faint rasp of cloth or leather against flesh. But that was nothing unusual. Thieves and\n",
        "beggars prowled these alleys all night, and they were not likely to attack him, after one look at his size\n",
        "and harness.\n",
        "But suddenly a door opened in the wall ahead of him, and he slipped into the shadow of an arch. A\n",
        "figure emerged from the open door and moved along the alley, not furtively, but with a natural\n",
        "noiselessness, like that of a jungle beast. Enough starlight filtered into the alley to silhouette the man's\n",
        "profile dimly as he passed the doorway where Conan lurked. The stranger was a Stygian. There was no\n",
        "mistaking that hawk-faced, shaven head, even in the starlight, nor the mantle over the broad shoulders.\n",
        "He passed on down the alley in the direction of the beach, and once Conan thought he must be carrying a\n",
        "lantern among his garments, for he caught a flash of lambent light, just as the man vanished.\n",
        "But the Cimmerian forgot the stranger as he noticed that the door through which he had emerged still\n",
        "stood open. Conan had intended entering by the main entrance and forcing Servio to show him the room\n",
        "where the Zingaran slept. But if he could get into the house without attracting anyone's attention, so\n",
        "much the better.\n",
        "A few long strides brought him to the door, and as his hands fell on the lock he stifled an involuntary\n",
        "grunt. His practised fingers, skilled among the thieves of Zamora long ago, told him that the lock had\n",
        "been forced, apparently by some terrific pressure from the outside that had twisted and bent the heavy\n",
        "iron bolts, tearing the very sockets loose from the jambs. How such damage could have been wrought so\n",
        "violently without awakening everyone in the neighborhood Conan could not imagine, but he felt sure\n",
        "that it had been done that night. A broken lock, if discovered, would not go unmended in the house of\n",
        "Servio, in this neighborhood of thieves and cutthroats.\n",
        "Conan entered stealthily, poniard in hand, wondering how he was to find the chamber of the Zingaran.\n",
        "Groping in total darkness he halted suddenly. He sensed death in that room, as a wild beast senses it--not\n",
        "as peril threatening him, but a dead thing, something freshly slain. In the darkness his foot hit and\n",
        "recoiled from something heavy and yielding. With a sudden premonition he groped along the wall until \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "541\n",
        "he found the shelf that supported the brass lamp, with its flint, steel and tinder beside it. A few seconds\n",
        "later a flickering, uncertain light sprang up, and he stared narrowly about him.\n",
        "A bunk built against the rough stone wall, a bare table and a bench completed the furnishings of the\n",
        "squalid chamber. An inner door stood closed and bolted. And on the hard-beaten dirt floor lay Beloso.\n",
        "On his back he lay, with his head drawn back between his shoulders so that he seemed to stare with his\n",
        "wide glassy eyes at the sooty beams of the cobwebbed ceiling. His lips were drawn back from his teeth in\n",
        "a frozen grin of agony. His sword lay near him, still in its scabbard. His shirt was torn open, and on his\n",
        "brown, muscular breast was the print of a black hand, thumb and four fingers plainly distinct.\n",
        "Conan glared in silence, feeling the short hairs bristle at the back of his neck.\n",
        "\"Crom!\" he muttered. \"The black hand of Set!\"\n",
        "He had seen that mark of old, the death-mark of the black priests of Set, the grim cult that ruled in dark\n",
        "Stygia. And suddenly he remembered that curious flash he had seen emanating from the mysterious\n",
        "Stygian who had emerged from this chamber.\n",
        "\"The Heart, by Crom!\" he muttered. \"He was carrying it under his mantle. He stole it. He burst that door\n",
        "by his magic, and slew Beloso. He was a priest of Set.\"\n",
        "A quick investigation confirmed at least part of his suspicions. The jewel was not on the Zingaran's body.\n",
        "An uneasy feeling rose in Conan that this had not happened by chance, or without design; a conviction\n",
        "that the mysterious Stygian galley had come into the harbor of Messantia on a definite mission. How\n",
        "could the priests of Set know that the Heart had come southward? Yet the thought was no more fantastic\n",
        "than the necromancy that could slay an armed man by the touch of an open, empty hand.\n",
        "A stealthy footfall outside the door brought him round like a great cat. With one motion he extinguished\n",
        "the lamp and drew his sword. His ears told him that men were out there in the darkness, were closing in\n",
        "on the doorway. As his eyes became accustomed to the sudden darkness, he could make out dim figures\n",
        "ringing the entrance. He could not guess their identity, but as always he took the initiative--leaping\n",
        "suddenly forth from the doorway without awaiting the attack.\n",
        "His unexpected movement took the skulkers by surprise. He sensed and heard men close about him, saw\n",
        "a dim masked figure in the starlight before him; then his sword crunched home, and he was fleeting\n",
        "away down the alley before the slower-thinking and slower-acting attackers could intercept him.\n",
        "As he ran he heard, somewhere ahead of him, a faint creak of oar- locks, and he forgot the men behind\n",
        "him. A boat was moving out into the bay! Gritting his teeth he increased his speed, but before he reached\n",
        "the beach he heard the rasp and creak of ropes, and the grind of the great sweep in its socket.\n",
        "Thick clouds, rolling up from the sea, obscured the stars. In thick darkness Conan came upon the strand,\n",
        "straining his eyes out across the black restless water. Something was moving out there--a long, low, black\n",
        "shape that receded in the darkness, gathering momentum as it went. To his ears came the rhythmical\n",
        "clack of long oars. He ground his teeth in helpless fury. It was the Stygian galley and she was racing out\n",
        "to sea, bearing with her the jewel that meant to him the throne of Aquilonia.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "542\n",
        "With a savage curse he took a step toward the waves that lapped against the sands, catching at his\n",
        "hauberk and intending to rip it off and swim after the vanishing ship. Then the crunch of a heel in the\n",
        "sand brought him about. He had forgotten his pursuers.\n",
        "Dark figures closed in on him with a rush of feet through the sands. The first went down beneath the\n",
        "Cimmerian's flailing sword, but the others did not falter. Blades whickered dimly about him in the\n",
        "darkness or rasped on his mail. Blood and entrails spilled over his hand and someone screamed as he\n",
        "ripped murderously upward. A muttered voice spurred on the attack, and that voice sounded vaguely\n",
        "familiar. Conan plowed through the clinging, hacking shapes toward the voice. A faint light gleaming\n",
        "momentarily through the drifting clouds showed him a tall gaunt man with a great livid scar on his\n",
        "temple. Conan's sword sheared through his skull as through a ripe melon.\n",
        "Then an ax, swung blindly in the dark, crashed on the king's basinet, filling his eyes with sparks of fire.\n",
        "He lurched and lunged, felt his sword sink deep and heard a shriek of agony. Then he stumbled over a\n",
        "corpse, and a bludgeon knocked the dented helmet from his head; the next instant the club fell full on his\n",
        "unprotected skull.\n",
        "The king of Aquilonia crumpled into the wet sands. Over him wolfish figures panted in the gloom.\n",
        "\"Strike off his head,\" muttered one.\n",
        "\"Let him be,\" grunted another. \"Help me tie up my wounds before I bleed to death. The tide will wash\n",
        "him into the bay. See, he fell at the water's edge. His skull's split; no man could live after such blows.\"\n",
        "\"Help me strip him,\" urged another. \"His harness will fetch a few pieces of silver. And haste. Tiberio is\n",
        "dead, and I hear seamen singing as they reel along the strand. Let us be gone.\"\n",
        "There followed hurried activity in the darkness, and then the sound of quickly receding footsteps. The\n",
        "tipsy singing of the seamen grew louder.\n",
        "In his chamber Publio, nervously pacing back and forth before a window that overlooked the shadowed\n",
        "bay, whirled suddenly, his nerves tingling. To the best of his knowledge the door had been bolted from\n",
        "within; but now it stood open and four men filed into the chamber. At the sight of them his flesh crawled.\n",
        "Many strange beings Publio had seen in his lifetime, but none before like these. They were tall and gaunt,\n",
        "black-robed, and their faces were dim yellow ovals in the shadows of their coifs. He could not tell much\n",
        "about their: features and was unreasoningly glad that he could not. Each bore a long, curiously molded\n",
        "staff.\n",
        "\"Who are you?\" he demanded, and his voice sounded brittle and hollow. \"What do you wish here?\"\n",
        "\"Where is Conan, he who was king of Aquilonia?\" demanded the tallest of the four in a passionless\n",
        "monotone that made Publio shudder. It was like the hollow tone of a Khitan temple bell.\n",
        "\"I do not know what you mean,\" stammered the merchant, his customary poise shaken by the uncanny\n",
        "aspect of his visitors. \"I know no such man.\"\n",
        "\"He has been here,\" returned the other with no change of inflection. \"His horse is in the courtyard. Tell us\n",
        "where he is before we do you an injury.\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "543\n",
        "\"Gebal!\" shouted Publio frantically, recoiling until he crouched against the wall. \"Gebal!\"\n",
        "The four Khitans watched him without emotion or change of expression.\n",
        "\"If you summon your slave, he will die,\" warned one of them, which only served to terrify Publio more\n",
        "than ever.\n",
        "\"Gebal!\" he screamed. \"Where are you, curse you? Thieves are murdering your master!\"\n",
        "Swift footsteps in the corridor outside, and Gebal burst into the chamber--a Shemite, of medium height\n",
        "and mightily muscled build, his curled blue-black beard bristling, and a short leaf-shaped sword in his\n",
        "hand.\n",
        "He stared in stupid amazement at the four invaders, unable to understand their presence; dimly\n",
        "remembering that he had drowsed unexplainably on the stair he was guarding and up which they must\n",
        "have come. He had never slept on duty before. But his master was shrieking with a note of hysteria in his\n",
        "voice, and the Shemite drove like a bull at the strangers, his thickly muscled arm drawing back for the\n",
        "disemboweling thrust. But the stroke was never dealt.\n",
        "A black-sleeved arm shot out, extending the long staff. Its end but touched the Shemite's brawny breast\n",
        "and was instantly withdrawn. The stroke was horribly like the dart and recovery of a serpent's head.\n",
        "Gebal halted short in his headlong plunge, as if he had encountered a solid barrier. His bull head toppled\n",
        "forward on his breast, the sword slipped from his fingers, and then he melted slowly to the floor. It was\n",
        "as if all the bones of his frame had suddenly become flabby. Publio turned sick.\n",
        "\"Do not shout again,\" advised the tallest Khitan. \"Your servants sleep soundly, but if you awaken them\n",
        "they will die, and you with them. Where is Conan?\"\n",
        "\"He is gone to the house of Servio, near the waterfront, to search for the Zingaran Beloso,\" gasped Publio,\n",
        "all his power of resistance gone out of him. The merchant did not lack courage; but these uncanny\n",
        "visitants turned his marrow to water. He started convulsively at a sudden noise of footsteps hurrying up\n",
        "the stair outside, loud in the ominous stillness.\n",
        "\"Your servant?\" asked the Khitan.\n",
        "Publio shook his head mutely, his tongue frozen to his palate.\n",
        "He could not speak.\n",
        "One of the Khitans caught up a silken cover from a couch and threw it over the corpse. Then they melted\n",
        "behind the tapestry, but before the tallest man disappeared, he murmured: \"Talk to this man who comes,\n",
        "and send him away quickly. If you betray us, neither he nor you will live to reach that door. Make no sign\n",
        "to show him that you are not alone.\" And lifting his staff suggestively, the yellow man faded behind the\n",
        "hangings.\n",
        "Publio shuddered and choked down a desire to retch. It might have been a trick of the light, but it seemed\n",
        "to him that occasionally those staffs moved slightly of their own accord, as if possessed of an unspeakable\n",
        "life of their own.\n",

        "544\n",
        "He pulled himself together with a mighty effort, and presented a composed aspect to the ragged ruffian\n",
        "who burst into the chamber.\n",
        "\"We have done as you wished, my lord,\" this man exclaimed. \"The barbarian lies dead on the sands at the\n",
        "water's edge.\"\n",
        "Publio felt a movement in the arras behind him, and almost burst from fright. The man swept heedlessly\n",
        "on.\n",
        "\"Your secretary, Tiberio, is dead. The barbarian slew him, and four of my companions. We bore their\n",
        "bodies to the rendezvous. There was nothing of value on the barbarian except a few silver coins. Are\n",
        "there any further orders?\"\n",
        "\"None!\" gasped Publio, white about the lips. \"Go!\"\n",
        "The desperado bowed and hurried out, with a vague feeling that Publio was both a man of weak stomach\n",
        "and few words.\n",
        "The four Khitans came from behind the arras.\n",
        "\"Of whom did this man speak?\" the taller demanded.\n",
        "\"Of a wandering stranger who did me an injury,\" panted Publio.\n",
        "\"You lie,\" said the Khitan calmly. \"He spoke of the king of Aquilonia. I read it in your expression. Sit upon\n",
        "that divan and do not move or speak. I will remain with you while my three companions go search for\n",
        "the body.\"\n",
        "So Publio sat and shook with terror of the silent, inscrutable figure which watched him, until the three\n",
        "Khitans filed back into the room, with the news that Conan's body did not lie upon the sands. Publio did\n",
        "not know whether to be glad or sorry.\n",
        "\"We found the spot where the fight was fought,\" they said. \"Blood was on the sand. But the king was\n",

        "\"Did you read naught from the sands?\" he asked.\n",
        "\"Aye,\" they answered. \"The king lives, and he has gone southward in a ship.\"\n",
        "The tall Khitan lifted his head and gazed at Publio, so that the merchant broke into a profuse sweat.\n",
        "\"What do you wish of me?\" he stuttered.\n",
        "\"A ship,\" answered the Khitan. \"A ship well manned for a very long voyage.\"\n",
        "\"For how long a voyage?\" stammered Publio, never thinking of refusing.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "545\n",

        "CONAN'S FIRST SENSATION of returning consciousness was that of motion; under him was no solidity,\n",
        "but a ceaseless heaving and plunging. Then he heard wind humming through cords and spars, and knew\n",
        "he was aboard a ship even before his blurred sight cleared. He heard a mutter of voices and then a dash\n",
        "of water deluged him, jerking him sharply into full animation. He heaved up with a sulfurous curse,\n",
        "braced his legs and glared about him, with a burst of coarse guffaws in his ears and the reek of unwashed\n",

        "He was standing on the poop-deck of a long galley, which was running before the wind that whipped\n",
        "down from the north, her striped sail bellying against the taut sheets. The sun was just rising, in a\n",
        "dazzling blaze of gold and blue and green. To the left of the shoreline was a dim purple shadow. To the\n",
        "right stretched the open ocean. This much Conan saw at a glance that likewise included the ship itself.\n",
        "It was long and narrow, a typical trading ship of the southern coasts, high of poop and stern, with cabins\n",
        "at either extremity. Conan looked down into the open waist, whence wafted that sickening abominable\n",
        "odor. He knew it of old. It was the body scent of the oarsmen, chained to their benches. They were all\n",
        "negroes, forty men to each side, each confined by a chain locked about his waist, with the other end\n",
        "welded to a heavy ring set deep in the solid runway beam that ran between the benches from stem to\n",
        "stern. The life of a slave aboard an Argossean galley was a hell unfathomable. Most of these were\n",
        "Kushites, but some thirty of the blacks who now rested on their idle oars and stared up at the stranger\n",
        "with dull curiosity were from the far southern isles, the homelands of the corsairs. Conan recognized\n",

        "But all this he saw and recognized in one swift, all-embracing glance as he rose, before he turned his\n",
        "attention to the figures about him. Reeling momentarily on braced legs, his fists clenched wrathfully, he\n",
        "glared at the figures clustered about him. The sailor who had drenched him stood grinning, the empty\n",
        "bucket still poised in his hand, and Conan cursed him with venom, instinctively reaching for his hilt.\n",
        "Then he discovered that he was weaponless and naked except for his short leather breeks.\n",
        "\"What lousy tub is this?\" he roared. \"How did I come aboard here?\"\n",

        "master henceforward.\"\n",
        "\"Then I'm headed in the direction I wanted to go, after all,\" muttered Conan, heedless of that last remark.\n",
        "They were racing southeastward, following the long curve of the Argossean coast. These trading ships\n",
        "never ventured far from the shoreline. Somewhere ahead of him he knew that low dark Stygian galley\n",

        "\"Have you sighted a Stygian galley--\" began Conan, but the beard of the burly, brutal-faced captain\n",

        "\"You mutinous swine!\" he bellowed, taking a threatening step forward, while he closed on his knife at his\n",

        "The captain drew his knife and ran at him bellowing, but before he could strike, Conan gripped his wrist\n",
        "with a wrench that tore the arm clean out of the socket. The captain bellowed like an ox in agony, and\n",
        "then rolled clear across the deck as he was hurled contemptuously from his attacker. Conan ripped a\n",
        "heavy ax from the rail and wheeled catlike to meet the rush of the sailors. They ran in, giving tongue like\n",

        "who, men said, was himself a serpent. Monsters such as this were kept in the temples of Set, and when\n",
        "they hungered, were allowed to crawl forth into the streets to take what prey they wished. Their ghastly\n",
        "feasts were considered a sacrifice to the scaly god.\n",
        "The Stygians within Conan's sight fell to their knees, men and women, and passively awaited their fate.\n",
        "One the great serpent would select, would lap in scaly coils, crush to a red pulp and swallow as a ratsnake swallows a mouse. The others would live. That was the will of the gods.\n",
        "But it was not Conan's will. The python glided toward him, its attention probably attracted by the fact\n",
        "that he was the only human in sight still standing erect. Gripping his great knife under his mantle, Conan\n",
        "hoped the slimy brute would pass him by. But it halted before him and reared up horrifically in the\n",
        "flickering torchlight, its forked tongue flickering in and out, its cold eyes glittering with the ancient\n",
        "cruelty of the serpent-folk. Its neck arched, but before it could dart, Conan whipped his knife from under\n",
        "his mantle and struck like a flicker of lightning. The broad blade split that wedge-shaped head and\n",
        "sheared deep into the thick neck.\n",
        "Conan wrenched his knife free and sprang clear as the great body knotted and looped and whipped\n",
        "terrifically in its death throes. In the moment that he stood staring in morbid fascination, the only sound\n",
        "was the thud and swish of the snake's tail against the stones.\n",
        "Then from the shocked votaries burst a terrible cry: \"Blasphemer! He has slain the sacred son of Set! Slay\n",
        "him! Slay! Slay!\"\n",
        "Stones whizzed about him and the crazed Stygians rushed at him, shrieking hysterically, while from all\n",
        "sides others emerged from their houses and took up the cry. With a curse Conan wheeled and darted into\n",
        "the black mouth of an alley. He heard the patter of bare feet on the flags behind him as he ran more by\n",
        "feel than by sight, and the walls resounded to the vengeful yells of the pursuers. Then his left hand found\n",
        "a break in the wall, and he turned sharply into another, narrower alley. On both sides rose sheer black\n",
        "stone walls. High above him he could see a thin line of stars. These giant walls, he knew, were the walls \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "554\n",
        "of temples. He heard, behind him, the pack sweep past the dark mouth in full cry. Their shouts grew\n",
        "distant, faded away. They had missed the smaller alley and run straight on in the blackness. He too kept\n",
        "straight ahead, though the thought of encountering another of Set's \"sons\" in the darkness brought a\n",
        "shudder from him.\n",
        "Then somewhere ahead of him he caught a moving glow, like that of a crawling glow-worm. He halted,\n",
        "flattened himself against the wall and gripped his knife. He knew what it was: a man approaching with a\n",
        "torch. Now it was so close he could make out the dark hand that gripped it, and the dim oval of a dark\n",
        "face. A few more steps and the man would certainly see him. He sank into a tigerish crouch--the torch\n",
        "halted. A door was briefly etched in the glow, while the torch-bearer fumbled with it. Then it opened, the\n",
        "tall figure vanished through it, and darkness closed again on the alley. There was a sinister suggestion of\n",
        "furtiveness about that slinking figure, entering the alley door in darkness; a priest, perhaps returning\n",
        "from some dark errand.\n",
        "But Conan groped toward the door. If one man came up that alley with a torch, others might come at any\n",
        "time. To retreat the way he had come might mean to run full into the mob from which he was fleeing. At\n",
        "any moment they might return, find the narrower alley and come howling down it. He felt hemmed in by\n",
        "those sheer, unscalable walls, desirous of escape, even if escape meant invading some unknown building.\n",
        "The heavy bronze door was not locked. It opened under his fingers and he peered through the crack. He\n",
        "was looking into a great square chamber of massive black stone. A torch smoldered in a niche in the wall.\n",
        "The chamber was empty. He glided through the lacquered door and closed it behind him.\n",
        "His sandaled feet made no sound as he crossed the black marble floor. A teak door stood partly open, and\n",
        "gliding through this, knife in hand, he came out into a great, dim, shadowy place whose lofty ceiling was\n",
        "only a hint of darkness high above him, toward which the black walls swept upward. On all sides blackarched doorways opened into the great still hall. It was lit by curious bronze lamps that gave a dim weird\n",
        "light. On the other side of the great hall a broad black marble stairway, without a railing, marched\n",
        "upward to lose itself in gloom, and above him on all sides dun galleries hung like black stone ledges.\n",
        "Conan shivered; he was in a temple of some Stygian god, if not Set himself, then someone only less grim.\n",
        "And the shrine did not lack an occupant. In the midst of the great hall stood a black stone altar, massive,\n",
        "somber, without carvings or ornament, and upon it coiled one of the great sacred serpents, its iridescent\n",
        "scales shimmering in the lamplight. It did not move, and Conan remembered stories that the priests kept\n",
        "these creatures drugged part of the time. The Cimmerian took an uncertain step out from the door, then\n",
        "shrank back suddenly, not into the room he had just quitted, but into a velvet-curtained recess. He had\n",
        "heard a soft step somewhere near by.\n",
        "From one of the black arches emerged a tall, powerful figure in sandals and silken loincloth, with a wide\n",
        "mantle trailing from his shoulders. But face and head were hidden by a monstrous mask, a half- bestial,\n",
        "half-human countenance, from the crest of which floated a mass of ostrich plumes.\n",
        "In certain ceremonies the Stygian priests went masked. Conan hoped the man would not discover him,\n",
        "but some instinct warned the Stygian. He turned abruptly from his destination, which apparently was the\n",
        "stair, and stepped straight to the recess. As he jerked aside the velvet hanging, a hand darted from the\n",
        "shadows, crushed the cry in his throat and jerked him headlong into the alcove, and the knife impaled\n",
        "him.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "555\n",
        "Conan's next move was the obvious one suggested by logic. He lifted off the grinning mask and drew it\n",
        "over his own head. The fisherman's mantle he flung over the body of the priest, which he concealed\n",
        "behind the hangings, and drew the priestly mantle about his own brawny shoulders. Fate had given him\n",
        "a disguise. All Khemi might well be searching now for the blasphemer who dared defend himself against\n",
        "a sacred snake; but who would dream of looking for him under the mask of a priest?\n",
        "He strode boldly from the alcove and headed for one of the arched doorways at random; but he had not\n",
        "taken a dozen strides when he wheeled again, all his senses edged for peril.\n",
        "A band of masked figures filed down the stair, appareled exactly as he was. He hesitated, caught in the\n",
        "open, and stood still, trusting to his disguise, though cold sweat gathered on his forehead and the backs\n",
        "of his hands. No word was spoken. Like phantoms they descended into the great hall and moved past\n",
        "him toward a black arch. The leader carried an ebon staff which supported a grinning white skull, and\n",
        "Conan knew it was one of the ritualistic processions so inexplicable to a foreigner, but which played a\n",
        "strong--and often sinister--part in the Stygian religion. The last figure turned his head slightly toward the\n",
        "motionless Cimmerian, as if expecting him to follow. Not to do what was obviously expected of him\n",
        "would rouse instant suspicion. Conan fell in behind the last man and suited his gait to their measured\n",
        "pace.\n",
        "They traversed a long, dark, vaulted corridor in which, Conan noticed uneasily, the skull on the staff\n",
        "glowed phosphorescently??. He felt a surge of unreasoning, wild animal panic that urged him to rip out\n",
        "his knife and slash right and left at these uncanny figures, to flee madly from this grim, dark temple. But\n",
        "he held himself in check, fighting down the dim monstrous intuitions that rose in the back of his mind\n",
        "and peopled the gloom with shadowy shapes of horror; and presently he barely stifled a sigh of relief as\n",
        "they filed through a great double- valved door which was three times higher than a man, and emerged\n",
        "into the starlight.\n",
        "Conan wondered if he dared fade into some dark alley; but hesitated, uncertain, and down the long dark\n",
        "street they padded silently, while such folk as they met turned their heads away and fled from them. The\n",
        "procession kept far out from the walls; to turn and bolt into any of the alleys they passed would be too\n",
        "conspicuous. While he mentally fumed and cursed, they came to a low-arched gateway in the southern\n",
        "wall, and through this they filed. Ahead of them and about them lay clusters of low, flat-topped mud\n",
        "houses, and palm groves, shadowy in the starlight. Now if ever, thought Conan, was his time to escape\n",
        "his silent companions.\n",
        "But the moment the gate was left behind them those companions were no longer silent. They began to\n",
        "mutter excitedly among themselves. The measured, ritualistic gait was abandoned, the staff with its skull\n",
        "was tucked unceremoniously under the leader's arm, and the whole group broke ranks and hurried\n",
        "onward. And Conan hurried with them. For in the low murmur of speech he had caught a word that\n",

        "A girl stood at the mouth of a smaller tunnel, staring fixedly at him. Her ivory skin showed her to be\n",
        "Stygian of some ancient noble family, and like all such women she was tall, lithe, voluptuously figured,\n",

        "\"Well, lead me out of this accursed temple, will you?\" Conan requested, his flesh crawling.\n",

        "\"Mad?\" Orastes turned a haggard stare upon him. \"Can any man see what I have seen and remain wholly\n",
        "sane? Yet I speak the truth. He plots the return of Acheron, with its towers and wizards and kings and\n",

        "before any could move, he had cast a handful of dust on the floor near the feet of the priest, who stood\n",
        "like a man turned to marble. It flamed, smoldered; a blue serpentine of smoke rose and swayed upward\n",
        "about Orastes in a slender spiral. And when it had risen above his shoulders it curled about his neck with\n",
        "a whipping suddenness like the stroke of a snake. Orastes' scream was choked to a gurgle. His hands flew\n",
        "to his neck, his eyes were distended, his tongue protruded. The smoke was like a blue rope about his neck;\n",

        "they bore it away.\n",
        "Dismissing the matter with a wave of his hand, Xaltotun seated himself at the ivory table about which sat\n",
        "the pale kings. \"Why are you in conclave?\" he demanded. \"The Aquilonians have risen in the west,\"\n",
        "answered Amalric, recovering from the grisly jolt the death of Orastes had given him. \"The fools believe\n",

        "subsided, which I think it would do the next day, could we not cross the river and destroy the\n",

        "Valerius laughed as he always laughed at the prospect of the ruin of either friend or foe, and drew a\n",

        "ever entered it, yet voices were often heard issuing from it; its walls billowed sometimes without a wind, \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "575\n",
        "and weird music came from it. Sometimes, deep in midnight, its silken walls were lit red by flames\n",
        "flickering within, limning misshapen silhouettes that passed to and fro.\n",
        "Lying in his own tent that night, Amalric heard the steady rumble of a drum in Xaltotun's tent; through\n",
        "the darkness it boomed steadily, and occasionally the Nemedian could have sworn that a deep, croaking\n",
        "voice mingled with the pulse of the drum. And he shuddered, for he knew that voice was not the voice of\n",
        "Xaltotun. The drum rustled and muttered on like deep thunder, heard afar off, and before dawn Amalric,\n",
        "glancing from his tent, caught the red flicker of lightning afar on the northern horizon. In all other parts\n",
        "of the sky the great stars blazed whitely. But the distant lightning flickered incessantly, like the crimson\n",

        "dawn the combined army moved westward.\n",
        "Ahead of him roved a swarm of scouts, and Amalric waited impatiently for them to return and tell of the\n",
        "Poitanians trapped beside a furious flood. But when the scouts met the column it was with the news that\n",
        "Conan had crossed the river!\n",
        "\"What?\" exclaimed Amalric. \"Did he cross before the flood?\"\n",
        "\"There was no flood,\" answered the scouts, puzzled. \"Late last night he came up to Tanasul and flung his\n",
        "army across.\"\n",
        "\"No flood?\" exclaimed Xaltotun, taken aback for the first time in Amalric's knowledge. \"Impossible! There\n",
        "were mighty rains upon the headwaters of the Shirki last night and the night before that!\"\n",
        "\"That may be, your lordship,\" answered the scout. \"It is true the water was muddy, and the people of\n",
        "Tanasul said that the river rose perhaps a foot yesterday; but that was not enough to prevent Conan's\n",
        "crossing.\"\n",
        "Xaltotun's sorcery had failed! The thought hammered in Amalric's brain. His horror of this strange man\n",
        "out of the past had grown steadily since that night in Belverus when he had seen a brown, shriveled\n",
        "mummy swell and grow into a living man. And the death of Orastes had changed lurking horror into\n",
        "active fear. In his heart was a grisly conviction that the man--or devil--was invincible. Yet now he had\n",
        "undeniable proof of his failure.\n",
        "Yet even the greatest of necromancers might fail occasionally, thought the baron. At any rate, he dared\n",
        "not oppose the man from Acheron--yet. Orastes was dead, writhing in Mitra only knew what nameless\n",
        "hell, and Amalric knew his sword would scarcely prevail where the black wisdom of the renegade priest\n",
        "had failed. What grisly abomination Xaltotun plotted lay in the unpredictable future. Conan and his host\n",
        "were a present menace against which Xaltotun's wizardry might well be needed before the play was all\n",
        "played.\n",
        "They came to Tanasul, a small fortified village at the spot where a reef of rocks made a natural bridge\n",
        "across the river, passable always except in times of greatest flood. Scouts brought in the news that Conan\n",
        "had taken up his position in the Goralian hills, which began to rise a few miles beyond the river. And just\n",
        "before sundown the Gundermen had arrived in his camp.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "576\n",
        "Amalric looked at Xaltotun, inscrutable and alien in the light of the flaring torches. Night had fallen.\n",
        "\"What now? Your magic has failed. Conan confronts us with an army nearly as strong as our own, and he\n",
        "has the advantage of position. We have a choice of two evils: to camp here and await his attack, or to fall\n",
        "back toward Tarantia and await reinforcements.\"\n",
        "\"We are ruined if we wait,\" answered Xaltotun. \"Cross the river and camp on the plain. We will attack at\n",
        "dawn.\"\n",
        "\"But his position is too strong!\" exclaimed Amalric.\n",
        "\"Fool!\" A gust of passion broke the veneer of the wizard's calm. \"Have you forgotten Valkia? Because\n",
        "some obscure elemental principle prevented the flood do you deem me helpless? I had intended that\n",
        "your spears should exterminate our enemies; but do not fear: it is my arts shall crush their host. Conan is\n",
        "in a trap. He will never see another sunset. Cross the river!\"\n",
        "They crossed by the flare of torches. The hoofs of the horses clinked on the rocky bridge, splashed\n",
        "through the shallows. The glint of the torches on shields and breastplates was reflected redly in the black\n",
        "water. The rock bridge was broad on which they crossed, but even so it was past midnight before the host\n",
        "was camped in the plain beyond. Above them they could see fires winking redly in the distance. Conan\n",
        "had tamed a bay in the Goralian hills, which had more than once before served as the last btand of an\n",
        "Aquilonian king. Amalric left his pavilion and strode restlessly through the camp.\n",
        "A weird glow flickered in Xaltotun's tent, and from time to time a demoniacal cry slashed the silence, and\n",
        "there was a low sinister muttering of a drum that rustled rather than rumbled.\n",
        "Amalric, his instincts whetted by the night and the circumstances, felt that Xaltotun was opposed by\n",
        "more than physical force. Doubts of the wizard's power assailed him. He glanced at the fires high above\n",
        "him, and his face set in grim lines. He and his army were deep in the midst of a hostile country. Up there\n",
        "among those hills lurked thousands of wolfish figures out of whose hearts and souls all emotion and\n",
        "hope had been scourged except a frenzied hate for their conquerors, a mad lust for vengeance. Defeat\n",
        "meant annihilation, retreat through a land swarming with blood-mad enemies. And on the morrow he\n",
        "must hurl his host against the grimmest fighter in the western nations, and his desperate horde. If\n",
        "Xaltotun failed them now--\n",
        "Half a dozen men-at-arms strode out of the shadows. The firelight glinted on their breastplates and\n",
        "helmet crests. Among them they half led, half dragged a gaunt figure in tattered rags. Saluting, they\n",
        "spoke: \"My lord, this man came to the outposts and said he desired word with King Valerius. He is an\n",
        "Aquilonian.\"\n",
        "He looked more like a wolf--a wolf the traps had scarred. Old sores that only fetters make showed on his\n",
        "wrists and ankles. A great brand, the mark of hot iron, disfigured his face. His eyes glared through the\n",
        "tangle of his matted hair as he half crouched before the baron.\n",
        "\"Who are you, you filthy dog?\" demanded the Nemedian. \"Call me Tiberias,\" answered the man, and his\n",
        "teeth clicked in an involuntary spasm. \"I have come to tell you how to trap Conan.\"\n",
        "\"A traitor, eh?\" rumbled the baron.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "577\n",
        "\"Men say you have gold,\" mouthed the man, shivering under his rags. \"Give some to me! Give me gold\n",
        "and I will show you how to defeat the king!\" His eyes glazed widely, his outstretched, upturned hands\n",
        "were spread like quivering claws.\n",
        "Amalric shrugged his shoulders in distaste. But no tool was too base for his use.\n",
        "\"If you speak the truth you shall have more gold than you can carry,\" he said. \"If you are a liar and a spy I\n",
        "will have you crucified head- down. Bring him along.\"\n",
        "In the tent of Valerius, the baron pointed to the man who crouched shivering before them, huddling his\n",
        "rags about him.\n",
        "\"He says he knows a way to aid us on the morrow. We will need aid, if Xaltotun's plan is no better than it\n",
        "has proved so far. Speak on, dog.\"\n",
        "The man's body writhed in strange convulsions. Words came in a stumbling rush:\n",
        "\"Conan camps at the head of the Valley of Lions. It is shaped like a fan, with steep hills on either side. If\n",
        "you attack him tomorrow you will have to march straight up the valley. You cannot climb the hills on\n",
        "either side. But if King Valerius will deign to accept my service, I will guide him through the hills and\n",
        "show him how he can come upon King Conan from behind. But if it is to be done at all, we must start\n",
        "soon. It is many hours' riding, for one must go miles to the west, then miles to the north, then turn\n",
        "eastward and so come into the Valley of Lions from behind, as the Gundermen came.\"\n",
        "Amalric hesitated, tugging his chin. In these chaotic times it was not rare to find men willing to sell their\n",
        "souls for a few gold pieces.\n",
        "\"If you lead me astray you will die,\" said Valerius. \"You are aware of that, are you not?\"\n",
        "The man shivered, but his wide eyes did not waver.\n",
        "\"If I betray you, slay me!\"\n",
        "\"Conan will not divide his force,\" mused Amalric. \"He will need all his men to repel our attack. He cannot\n",
        "spare any to lay ambushes in the hills. Besides, this fellow knows his hide depends on his leading you as\n",
        "he promised. Would a dog like him sacrifice himself? Nonsense! No, Valerius, I believe the man is\n",
        "honest.\"\n",
        "\"Or a greater thief than most, for he would sell his liberator,\" laughed Valerius. \"Very well. I will follow\n",
        "the dog. How many men can you spare me?\"\n",
        "\"Five thousand should be enough,\" answered Amalric. \"A surprize attack on their rear will throw them\n",
        "into confusion, and that will be enough. I shall expect your attack about noon.\"\n",
        "\"You will know when I strike,\" answered Valerius. As Amalric returned to his pavilion he noted with\n",
        "gratification that Xaltotun was still in his tent, to judge from the blood-freezing cries that shuddered forth\n",
        "into the night air from time to time. When presently he heard the clink of steel and the jingle of bridles in\n",
        "the outer darkness, he smiled grimly. Valerius had about served his purpose. The baron knew that Conan\n",
        "was like a wounded lion that rends and tears even in his death throes. When Valerius struck from the \n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "578\n",
        "rear, the desperate strokes of the Cimmerian might well wipe his rival out of existence before he himself\n",
        "succumbed. So much the better. Amalric felt he could well dispense with Valerius, once he had paved the\n",
        "way for a Nemedian victory.\n",
        "The five thousand horsemen who accompanied Valerius were hard-bitten Aquilonian renegades for the\n",
        "most part. In the still starlight they moved out of the sleeping camp, following the westward trend of the\n",
        "great black masses that rose against the stars ahead of them. Valerius rode at their head, and beside him\n",
        "rode Tiberias, a leather thong about his wrist gripped by a man-at-arms who rode on the other side of\n",
        "him. Others kept close behind with drawn swords.\n",
        "\"Play us false and you die instantly,\" Valerius pointed out. \"I do not know every sheep-path in these hills,\n",
        "but I know enough about the general configuration of the country to know the directions we must take to\n",
        "come in behind the Valley of Lions. See that you do not lead us astray.\"\n",
        "The man ducked his head and his teeth chattered as he volubly assured his captor of his loyalty, staring\n",
        "up stupidly at the banner that floated over him, the golden serpent of the old dynasty.\n",
        "Skirting the extremities of the hills that locked the Valley of Lions, they swung wide to the west. An\n",
        "hour's ride and they turned north, forging through wild and rugged hills, following dim trails and\n",
        "tortuous paths. Sunrise found them some miles northwest of Conan's position, and here the guide turned\n",
        "eastward and led them through a maze of labyrinths and crags. Valerius nodded, judging their position\n",
        "by various peaks thrusting up above the others. He had kept his bearings in a general way, and he knew\n",
        "they were still headed in the right direction.\n",
        "But now, without warning, a gray fleecy mass came billowing down from the north, veiling the slopes,\n",
        "spreading out through the valleys. It blotted out the sun; the world became a blind gray void in which\n",
        "visibility was limited to a matter of yards. Advance became a stumbling, groping muddle. Valerius\n",
        "cursed. He could no longer see the peaks that had served him as guideposts. He must depend wholly\n",
        "upon the traitorous guide. The golden serpent drooped in the windless air.\n",
        "Presently Tiberias seemed himself confused; he halted, stared about uncertainly.\n",
        "\"Are you lost, dog?\" demanded Valerius harshly.\n",
        "\"Listen!\"\n",
        "Somewhere ahead of them a faint vibration began, the rhythmic rumble of a drum.\n",
        "\"Conan's drum!\" exclaimed the Aquilonian.\n",
        "\"If we are close enough to hear the drum,\" said Valerius, \"why do we not hear the shouts and the clang of\n",
        "arms? Surely battle has joined.\"\n",
        "\"The gorges and the winds play strange tricks,\" answered Tiberias, his teeth chattering with the ague that\n",
        "is frequently the lot of men who have spent much time in damp underground dungeons. \"Listen!\"\n",
        "\"They are fighting down in the valley!\" cried Tiberias. \"The drum is beating on the heights. Let us hasten!\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "579\n",
        "He rode straight on toward the sound of the distant drum as one who knows his ground at last. Valerius\n",
        "followed, cursing the fog. Then it occurred to him that it would mask his advance. Conan could not see\n",
        "him coming. He could be at the Cimmerian's back before the noonday sun dispelled the mists.\n",
        "Just now he could not tell what lay on either hand, whether cliffs, thickets or gorges. The drum throbbed\n",
        "unceasingly, growing louder as they advanced, but they heard no more of the battle. Valerius had no idea\n",
        "toward what point of the compass they were headed. He started as he saw gray rock walls looming\n",
        "through the smoky drifts on either hand, and realized that they were riding through a narrow defile. But\n",
        "the guide showed no sign of nervousness, and Valerius hove a sigh of relief when the walls widened out\n",
        "and became invisible in the fog. They were through the defile; if an ambush had been planned, it would\n",
        "have been made in that pass.\n",
        "But now Tiberias halted again. The drum was rumbling louder, and Valerius could not determine from\n",
        "what direction the sound was coming. Now it seemed ahead of him, now behind, now on one hand or the\n",
        "other. Valerius glared about him impatiently, sitting on his war-horse with wisps of mist curling about\n",
        "him and the moisture gleaming on his armor. Behind him the long lines of steel-clad riders faded away\n",
        "and away like phantoms into the mist. \"Why do you tarry, dog?\" he demanded. The man seemed to be\n",
        "listening to the ghostly drum. Slowly he straightened in his saddle, turned his head and faced Valerius,\n",
        "and the smile on his lips was terrible to see.\n",
        "\"The fog is thinning, Valerius,\" he said in a new voice, pointing a bony finger. \"Look!\"\n",
        "The drum was silent. The fog was fading away. First the crests of cliffs came in sight above the gray\n",
        "clouds, tall and spectral. Lower and lower crawled the mists, shrinking, fading. Valerius started up in his\n",
        "stirrups with a cry that the horsemen echoed behind him. On all sides of them the cliffs towered. They\n",
        "were not in a wide, open valley as he had supposed. They were in a blind gorge walled by sheer cliffs\n",
        "hundreds of feet high. The only entrance or exit was the narrow defile through which they had ridden.\n",
        "\"Dog!\" Valerius struck Tiberias full in the mouth with his clenched mailed hand. \"What devil's trick is\n",
        "this?\" Tiberias spat out a mouthful of blood and shook with fearful laughter.\n",
        "\"A trick that shall rid the world of a beast! Look, dog!\" Again Valerius cried out, more in fury than in fear.\n",
        "The defile was blocked by a wild and terrible band of men who stood silent as images--ragged, shockheaded men with spears in their hands-hundreds of them. And up on the cliffs appeared other faces--\n",
        "thousands of faces--wild, gaunt, ferocious faces, marked by fire and steel and starvation. \"A trick of\n",
        "Conan's!\" raged Valerius.\n",
        "\"Conan knows nothing of it,\" laughed Tiberias. \"It was the plot of broken men, of men you ruined and\n",
        "turned to beasts. Amalric was right. Conan has not divided his army. We are the rabble who followed\n",
        "him, the wolves who skulked in these hills, the homeless men, the hopeless men. This was our plan, and\n",

        "\"Your arts are straws in the wind, dog of Python,\" answered the Asurian. \"Have you wondered why the\n",

        "would conserve my powers for the great days to be, rather than employ them in a hill-country brawl. But\n",

        "\"Not I! It has been on a long journey far to the southward. But now it is in my hands, and your black arts\n",
        "cannot stand against it. As it resurrected you, so shall it hurl you back into the night whence it drew you.\n",

        "Formations had been destroyed utterly, close-knit bands broken asunder and swept apart. The crest of\n",
        "Trocero gleamed in one part of the plain, those of Prospero and Pallantides in others. Conan was alone.\n",
        "The house-troops of Tarascus had fallen one by one. The two kings met man to man.\n",
        "Even as they rode at each other, the horse of Tarascus sobbed and sank under him. Conan leaped from\n",
        "his own steed and ran at him, as the king of Nemedia disengaged himself and rose. Steel flashed\n",
        "blindingly in the sun, clashed loudly, and blue sparks flew; then a clang of armor as Tarascus measured\n",
        "his full length on the earth beneath a thunderous stroke of Conan's broadsword.\n",
        "The Cimmerian paced a mail-shod foot on his enemy's breast, and lifted his sword. His helmet was gone;\n",
        "he shook back his black mane and his blue eyes blazed with their old fire.\n",
        "\"Do you yield?\"\n",
        "\"Will you give me quarter?\" demanded the Nemedian.\n",
        "\"Aye. Better than you'd have given me, you dog. Life for you and all your men who throw down their\n",
        "arms. Though I ought to split your head for an infernal thief,\" the Cimmerian added.\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "587\n",
        "Tarascus twisted his neck and glared over the plain. The remnants of the Nemedian host were flying\n",
        "across the stone bridge with swarms of victorious Aquilonians at their heels, smiting with the fury of\n",
        "glutted vengeance. Bossonians and Gundermen were swarming through the camp of their enemies,\n",
        "tearing the tents to pieces in search of plunder, seizing prisoners, ripping open the baggage and upsetting\n",
        "the wagons.\n",
        "Tarascus cursed fervently, and then shrugged his shoulders, as well as he could, under the circumstances.\n",
        "\"Very well. I have no choice. What are your demands?\"\n",
        "\"Surrender to me all your present holdings in Aquilonia. Order your garrisons to march out of the castles\n",
        "and towns they hold, without their arms, and get your infernal armies out of Aquilonia as quickly as\n",
        "possible. In addition you shall return all Aquilonians sold as slaves, and pay an indemnity to be\n",
        "designated later, when the damage your occupation of the country has caused has been properly\n",
        "estimated. You will remain as hostage until these terms have been carried out.\"\n",
        "\"Very well,\" surrendered Tarascus. \"I will surrender all the castles and towns now held by my garrisons\n",
        "without resistance, and all the other things shall be done. What ransom for my body?\"\n",
        "Conan laughed and removed his foot from his foe's steel-clad breast, grasped his shoulder and heaved\n",
        "him to his feet. He started to speak, then turned to see Hadrathus approaching him. The priest was as\n",
        "calm and self-possessed as ever, picking his way between rows of dead men and horses.\n",
        "Conan wiped the sweat-smeared dust from his face with bloodstained hand. He had fought all through\n",
        "the day, first on foot with the pikemen, then in the saddle, leading the charge. His surcoat was gone, his\n",
        "armor splashed with blood and battered with strokes of sword, mace and ax. He loomed gigantically\n",
        "against a background of blood and slaughter, like some grim pagan hero of mythology.\n",
        "\"Well done, Hadrathus!\" quoth he gustily. \"By Crom, I am glad to see your signal! My knights were\n",
        "almost mad with impatience and eating their hearts out to be at sword strokes. I could not have held\n",
        "them much longer. What of the wizard?\"\n",
        "\"He has gone down the dim road to Acheron,\" answered Hadrathus. \"And I-I am for Tarantia. My work is\n",
        "done here, and I have a task to perform at the temple of Mitra. All our work is done here. On this field we\n",
        "have saved Aquilonia--and more than Aquilonia. Your ride to your capital will be a triumphal procession\n",
        "through a kingdom mad with joy. All Aquilonia will be cheering the return of their king. And so, until we\n",
        "meet again in the great royal hall--farewell!\"\n",
        "Conan stood silently watching the priest as he went. From various parts of the field knights were\n",
        "hurrying toward him. He saw Pallantides, Trocero, Prospero, Servius, Gallannus, their armor splashed\n",
        "with crimson. The thunder of battle was giving way to a roar of triumph and acclaim. All eyes, hot with\n",
        "strife and shining with exultation, were turned toward the great black figure of the king; mailed arms\n",
        "brandished red-stained swords. A confused torrent of sound rose, deep and thunderous as the sea-surf:\n",
        "\"Hail, Conan, king of Aquilonia!\"\n",
        "Tarascus spoke.\n",
        "\"You have not yet named my ransom.\"\n",
        "The Hour of the Dragon\n",
        "Conan laughed and slapped his sword home in its scabbard. He flexed his mighty arms, and ran his\n",
        "bloodstained fingers through his thick black locks, as if feeling there his rewon crown.\n",
        "\"There is a girl in your seraglio named Zenobia.\"\n",
        "\"Why, yes, so there is.\"\n",
        "\"Very well.\" The king smiled as at an exceedingly pleasant memory. \"She shall be your ransom, and\n",
        "naught else. I will come to Belverus for her as I promised. She was a slave in Nemedia, but I will make\n",
        "her queen of Aquilonia!\"\n"
